A Different View () is a Spanish dramatic television series created by Josep Cister and Jaime Vaca and starring Macarena García, Patricia López Arnaiz, Ana Wagener, Cecilia Freire, and others. The show is set in 1920s Seville and deals with feminist issues. The two seasons of the show originally aired from 25 April 2018 to 15 July 2019 on La 1. == Plot == Set in an academy for young ladies in Seville in the 1920s, A Different View shows a teaching center clinging to an unwavering way of doing things and conditioned by the traditions of the city and those years. All this universe and its pillars wobble with the arrival of a new teacher who has a very different way of seeing things and who has a secret objective directly related to the academy. The search for the own voice of a group of adult and young women will be the destiny of the protagonists. == Topics covered == Each chapter in both seasons deals with problems and themes that occurred in 1920: the history of Elena Maseras, female teaching, the role of women in sport over the years, feminism as a collective movement and the importance of mutual support among women, the need for women to tell their stories so that no one else speaks for them, the existence of feminist artworks such as "El pelele" by Francisco de Goya, the knowledge that sexuality goes beyond male pleasure and self-knowledge of female orgasm, and the value of self-love, mental health and understanding racism. == Cast and characters == Source: === First season (2018) === ==== Main cast ==== * Macarena García - Manuela Martín Casado * Patricia López Arnaiz - Teresa Blanco Sánchez * Ana Wagener - Luisa Fernández Mayoral * Cecilia Freire - Ángela López Castaño ==== Secondary cast ==== * Gloria Muñoz - Doña Manuela Casado García (Episode 1 - Episode 5, Episode 7 - Episode 8, Episode 11, Episode 13) * Carlos Olalla - Don Pascual Martín (Episode 1 - Episode 4, Episode 7 - Episode 8, Episode 13) * Begoña Vargas - Roberta Luna Miñambres * Lucía Díez - Margarita Ortega-Sánchez Camaño y López de Carrizosa * Carla Campra - Flavia Cardesa González * Paula de la Nieta - Macarena Panduro Alén * Abril Montilla - María Jesús Junio Crespo * Elena Gallardo - Candela Megía Rodas * Juanlu González - Ramón * Álvaro Mel - Tomás Peralta García de Blas (Episode 1 - Episode 5, Episode 7 - Episode 13) * Pepa Gracia - Paula Alén (Episode 3, Episode 5, Episode 7, Episode 9, Episode 12 - Episode 13) * Jordi Coll - Martín Arteaga Gómez-Berzosa (Episode 3 - Episode 4, Episode 7 - Episode 8, Episode 11 - Episode 13) * Alejandro Sigüenza - David (Episode 3, Episode 5, Episode 9, Episode 11 - Episode 13) * José Pastor - Rafael "Rafita" Peralta García de Blas (Episode 1 - Episode 4, Episode 7 - Episode 8) * José Luis Barquero - Álvaro Peralta García de Blas (Episode 1 - Episode 4, Episode 7 - Episode 8) * Celia Freijeiro - María Antonia Miñambres (Episode 5 - Episode 6, Episode 8, Episode 13) * Filipe Duarte - Vanildo "Nildo" Zacarías de Azevedo (Episode 1 - Episode 6, Episode 13) ==== Episodic cast ==== === Second season (2019) === ==== Main cast ==== * Macarena García - Manuela Martín Casado * Patricia López Arnaiz - Teresa Blanco Sánchez * Ana Wagener - Luisa Fernández Mayoral * Melina Matthews - Carmen Lara ==== Secondary cast ==== * Carla Campra - Flavia Cardesa González * Lucía Díez - Margarita Ortega-Sánchez Camaño y López de Carrizosa * Begoña Vargas - Roberta Luna Miñambres * Abril Montilla - María Jesús Junio Crespo * Paula de la Nieta - Macarena Panduro Alén * Elena Gallardo - Candela Megía Rodas * Dariam Coco - Inés * Gloria Muñoz - Doña Manuela Casado García (Episode 14/1, Episode 16/3 - Episode 21/8) * Jordi Coll - Martín Arteaga Gómez-Berzosa (Episodio 14/1, Episode 16/3 - Episode 19/6, Episode 21/8) * Álvaro Mel - Tomás Peralta García de Blas * Juanlu González - Ramón * Javier Mora - Don Rafael Peralta (Episode 14/1 - Episode 15/2, Episode 17/4, Episode 19/6 - Episode 21/8) * César Vicente - Elías * José Pastor - Rafael "Rafita" Peralta García de Blas (Episode 15/2 - Episode 19/6, Episode 21/8) * José Luis Barquero - Álvaro Peralta García de Blas (Episode 15/2 - Episode 16/3, Episode 21/8) * Carlos Olalla - Don Pascual Martín (Episode 17/4 - Episode 20/7) * Paco Mora - Arcadio Pérez Fernández (Episode 20/7) * Raúl Ferrando - Enrique Hidalgo (Episode 15/2, Episode 17/4 - Episode 20/7) * Cecilia Freire - Ángela López Castaño (Episode 14/1, Episode 19/6) * Pepa Gracia - Paula Alén (Episode 19/6) * Javier Ambrossi - Benito Padilla (Episode 16/3) * Javier Calvo - Jorge Merlot (Episode 16/3) * Joaquín Notario - Vicente Martínez (Episode 14/1 - Episode 16/3, Episode 18/5; Episode 20/7 - Episode 21/8) * Celia Freijeiro - María Antonia Miñambres (Episode 14/1, Episode 17/4) ==== Episodic cast ==== == Production and release == Created by Josep Cister and Jaime Vaca, La otra mirada was produced by RTVE in collaboration with Boomerang TV.
