The meeting was scheduled late at night and was to include, apart from Hitler, Hermann Göring and Joachim von Ribbentrop. The elderly Hácha was humiliated by being deliberately kept waiting for hours, because Hitler was at that time watching the film A Hopeless Case, which ended past midnight. He was summoned by Hitler at 1:15 AM, who informed him that German troops would march into Czechoslovakia at 6:00 AM, on the pretext that the Czechs were disturbing the peace in Europe. In the antechamber, Göring and Ribbentrop pressed Hácha to sign a document legalizing the invasion. When Hácha hesitated, Göring threatened to bomb Prague, whereupon Hácha fainted. Revived by injection, Hácha signed a document in the presence of Hitler accepting the invasion and annexation of Czech lands into the Third Reich, which began in the early morning of 15 March 1939. == References == ==Bibliography== * == External links == * Category:1939 films Category:1939 comedy films Category:German comedy films Category:Films of Nazi Germany Category:1930s German-language films Category:Films directed by Erich Engel Category:Films set in Berlin Category:Films set in universities and colleges Category:German black-and- white films Category:1930s German films
