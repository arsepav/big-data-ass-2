The series premiered on Sunday, May 31, 2009 at 9:30 p.m. on RecordTV.A Fazenda começou. Gostou da estreia? Já tem um favorito? The show is based on a group of celebrities living together twenty-four hours a day in a Farm (located in Itu during first eight seasons, and in Itapecerica da Serra since season nine), isolated from the outside world (primarily from mass media, such as newspapers, telephones, television and the internet) while having all their steps followed by cameras around-the-clock, with no privacy for three months.Record estreia reality show rural com 14 celebridades The contestants compete for the chance to win the grand prize by avoiding weekly eviction, until the last celebrity remains at the end of the season that can claim the grand prize.Reality show "A Fazenda" estreia domingo The show was originally presented by news reporter Britto Junior, a position he held throughout the first seven seasons. Roberto Justus later replaced Britto as the host of the series from the eighth season onwards. Since 2010, the subscription-based live feeds are available directly through R7.com. In order to preserve the drama for television broadcasts, RecordTV does not webcast certain moments that transpire in the house, including weekly competitions.Record fecha com TVA para pay-per-view de A FazendaRecord estreia reality show "A Fazenda" neste domingo ==Format== A property with over 150 thousand square meters in Itu, in the countryside of São Paulo, was especially prepared, with camera installations, power towers, microphones and all necessary infrastructure for the production. After eight seasons, the reality show leaves the Toca dos Leões site in Itu and moves to Toca do Tuim, located in Itapecerica da Serra. Each season, the 14-22 celebrities, such as actors, singers, models, digital influencers or media personalities, known as Farmers, need to prove abilities to work in the country: wake up very early, take care of the cows, wash the horses, collect eggs from chickens, harvest greens, and more. The show airs daily and each season lasts about three months. ==Season chronology== Season Number of farmers Number of weeks Finalists Finalists Finalists Finalists Finalists Finalists Finalists Finalists Season Number of farmers Number of weeks Winner Vote Runner-up Vote Third place Vote Fourth place Vote 1 15 12 Dado Dolabella Danni Carlos rowspan="2" colspan=2 rowspan="11" colspan=2 2 14 13 Karina Bacchi André Segatti 3 15 12 Daniel Bueno Sérgio Abreu Lizi Benites 4 18 12 Joana Machado Monique Evans Raquel Pacheco 5 16 13 Viviane Araújo Felipe Folgosi Léo Áquilla 6 16 14 Bárbara Evans Denise Rocha Marcos Oliver 7 17 13 DH Silveira Babi Rossi Heloísa Faissol 8 16 11 Douglas Sampaio Minerato Luka Ribeiro 9 16 13 Flávia Viana Marcos Härter Matheus Lisboa 10 16 12 Rafael Ilha João Zoli Caíque Aguiar 11 17 12 Lucas Viana Hariany Almeida Diego Grossi 12 20 14 Jojo Todynho Biel Stéfani Bays Lipe Ribeiro 13 25 13 Rico Melquiades Bil Araújo Solange Gomes Marina Ferrari 14 25 13 Bárbara Borges Bia Miranda Iran Malfitano rowspan="1" colspan=2 ===Fazenda de Verão=== Fazenda de Verão (English: Summer Farm) was spin-off of A Fazenda, but with anonymous people, instead of the celebrities playing the role of farmers.
