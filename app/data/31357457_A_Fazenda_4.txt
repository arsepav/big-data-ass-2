Model Dani Bolina entered the game on August 11, 2011 as Duda's replacement. The fact that gained much media attention since the incident and even more after the ejection. The network's decision was highly praised by the press and viewers. ===Thiago Gagliasso=== On September 7, 2011, actor Thiago Gagliasso made a controversial comment regarding that he has slapped some goats behind the chicken coop, a place that, according to him, there would be no cameras. A YouTube user posted the clip of the comment online. Several NGOs such as PEA, manifested on Twitter asking for Thiago's ejection. Record, broadcaster of the program, released a public statement on September 8 regarding the controversial statement stating that the farm is monitored 24 hours a day and in no time, Thiago or any other contestant was caught assaulting a goat or any other animal. The chicken coop area where the goats cross during the morning activity, is filmed and images of Thiago on that area have already been aired. All the farm animals are healthy, well cared and daily monitoring. TV host Luísa Mell, known for her work to protect animals, began a campaign to evict the actor. Singer Rita Lee was also outraged and used Twitter to express herself. "Bruno Gagliasso sorry, but your brother is a jerk. Get Thiago out!", she wrote. Despite Record statement, the controversy only increased. As result of Thiago Gagliasso's behaviour, on September 10, all contestants had to sleep outside the farmhouse as a punishment. Farmer of the week Raquel Pacheco read a warning statement from the production: "All animals deserve respect and care". The actor apologized to the house, but was outraged at the punishment. Valesca asked him to control himself when he began to curse the animals. ==References== ==External links== * Official Site Category:2011 Brazilian television seasons Category:A Fazenda
