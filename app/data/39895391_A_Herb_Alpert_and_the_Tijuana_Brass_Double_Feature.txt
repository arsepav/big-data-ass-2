In "Spanish Flea", a flea bothers various animals until it is chased away from them by a group of men. In "Tijuana Taxi", a rickety and old purple taxi in Tijuana picks up a disproportionate number of people who have to catch a plane at the local airport. After a crazy ride through the streets of Tijuana (including a short visit to a bullfighting arena), the taxi driver is delayed by a customs officer, who takes a long time in stamping the passports for the driver's numerous customers, and he misses the plane. However, he makes up for it by having his taxi fly away. The music used to introduce the film during its opening credits is the band's "The Mexican Shuffle." ==Film preservation== The Academy Film Archive preserved A Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature in 2003. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1966 films Category:1966 animated films Category:1960s animated short films Category:Animated films without speech Category:Best Animated Short Academy Award winners Category:Films directed by John Hubley Category:Music videos Category:Paramount Pictures short films
