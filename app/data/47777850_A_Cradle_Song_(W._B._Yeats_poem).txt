YEATS 2008 William Butler Yeats. 25 A Cradle Song The angels are stooping Above your bed; They weary of trooping With the whimpering dead. God's laughing in Heaven To see you so good; The Sailing Seven Are gay with His mood. I sigh that kiss you, . The earlier version by Yeats was set as a war song by Ivor Gurney (1920).Trevor Hold: Parry to Finzi: Twenty English Song-composers (2005), p 281. "Cradle Song (1920, 1959) is a wistful lullaby, in which the cradle- rocking accompaniment is subtly and sparingly used. Gurney sets an early version of Yeats's poem, so however much one prefers the later words (printed by the editors in small type), the song should be sung to the earlier version." ==References== Category:Poetry by W.
