62331905	A Dream About Lightning Bugs	A Dream About Lightning Bugs: A Life of Music and Cheap Lessons is a memoir written by musician Ben Folds, first published in July 2019. It reflects on his early life, time as a member of Ben Folds Five, and his solo career to the near present. ==Reception== The book received generally positive reviews and became a New York Times Best Seller. Allison Stewart of The Washington Post commented, "Once an artist plays their first sold-out show, or signs their first record deal, they are no longer relatable human beings whose experiences in earlier chapters — childhood crushes, bullies, trouble at school — mirror our own. [...] It’s an unbridgeable gap, one that Ben Folds, a singer, pianist and musical Everyman whose relatability seems to have been factory-issued, does his best to navigate in his engaging and solid new memoir." John Young of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette stated that the book, "offers a glimpse inside the head of another musical genius while also being one of the best-written, most interesting musical memoirs of the rock era." == References == Category:2019 non-fiction books Category:American memoirs Category:Music autobiographies Category:Ben Folds Category:Ballantine Books books
