They made their debut in a surprise performance for the concert video Live at Worthy Farm, produced by Glastonbury Festival and streamed on May 22, 2021. The Smile began working on A Light for Attracting Attention shortly before the first UK COVID-19 lockdowns, with Radiohead's longtime producer Nigel Godrich. According to Yorke, Greenwood and Skinner "had already tracked about four things before I even knew what was going on". Yorke wrote the lyrics in his home during the lockdowns; he recorded his vocals to Godrich's studio from his home using streaming software, before his children returned from school each day. Yorke said "It got sort of protracted ... It was deeply frustrating, but it's been the same for everybody." According to Greenwood, the album was almost complete by September 2021. Yorke performed a Smile song, "Free in the Knowledge", at the Letters Live event at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in October. On January 29 and 30, the Smile performed to an audience for the first time at three shows at Magazine, London, which were livestreamed. Yorke first performed "Skrting on the Surface" in 2009, and in a different arrangement in 2012 with Radiohead. He first performed "Open the Floodgates" solo in 2009. ==Composition== A Light for Attracting Attention is an art rock, post-punk, progressive rock, electronica, and Afrobeats album that explores elements of math rock, post- rock, grunge, electro-rock, psychedelic rock desert rock, funk, jazz, breakbeat, wonky, and systems music. == Artwork == The cover art was created by Yorke with the longtime Radiohead collaborator Stanley Donwood. It was inspired by medieval maps made by an Arab pirate, and early maps of the British Isles depicting the locations of springs and rivers. Unlike their previous collaborations, which typically involved digital processing, Yorke and Donwood worked entirely on the canvas, using gouache paint. == Release and promotion == The Smile's debut single, "You Will Never Work in Television Again", was released to streaming services on 5 January, 2022. On 27 January, they released "The Smoke", followed by "Skrting on the Surface" on 17 March. "Pana-vision", was released on 3 April alongside a new solo song from Yorke, "That's How Horses Are"; both were used in the series finale of the television series Peaky Blinders, broadcast that day. "Free in the Knowledge" was released on 20 April, followed by "Thin Thing" on 9 May. In March, the Smile released a 7-inch vinyl of "You Will Never Work In Television Again" and "The Smoke" through a lottery in independent record stores. The Smile announced A Light for Attracting Attention on 20 April 2022, alongside the "Free in the Knowledge" single. It was released digitally through XL Recordings on 13 May, with a physical release on 17 June. The Smile began a European tour in May, followed by a North American tour starting in November. They were supported by the saxophonist Robert Stillman, who also joined them for some songs. The tour included performances on The Tonight Show, NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts and KEXP. In November, the Smile released a special edition of the album through Rough Trade. They also released a limited 10-inch vinyl featuring live tracks and a reading of William Blake's poem "The Smile" by the actor Cillian Murphy, which was used as the introduction for the Smile's live shows. On 14 December, the Smile released a digital-only EP, The Smile (Live at Montreux Jazz Festival, July 2022), with songs from their performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival, Switzerland. It was followed by a limited-edition vinyl EP, Europe: Live Recordings 2022. == Reception == On Metacritic, A Light for Attracting Attention has a score of 86 out of 100 based on 23 reviews from critics, indicating "universal acclaim".

The critic Zach Schonfeld wrote that its best moments equalled any of Yorke and Greenwood's work since the 2007 Radiohead album In Rainbows, and that "it almost makes you want to send Radiohead's other three members a sympathy card". In the Guardian, Alexis Petridis named it album of the week, writing that it "may not be head-spinningly different, but is still exceptional". A Light for Attracting Attention initially reached number 19 on the UK Albums Chart. After its retail release a month later, it reached number five.
