A Family () is a 2004 South Korean drama film starring Soo Ae and Joo Hyun, and written and directed by Lee Jung-chul. ==Plot== Jeong-eun, a former pickpocket with four prior convictions, is released from prison after serving a three-year sentence. She reunites with her younger brother, Jeong-hwan, and father, Ju-seok, the latter with whom she has a troubled relationship. Ju- seok, an ex-cop-turned-fishmonger, hides his love and concern for his daughter beneath a gruff exterior. Though Jeong-eun is tough and rebellious, she is fiercely protective of her brother and father, and is genuinely determined to put her life in order this time. While under probation, she works as an assistant at a beauty salon, hoping to someday open her own salon with the money she has saved. But Chang-won, who was once her partner in crime and now leads his own gang, not only refuses to give Jeong-eun her cut of their last job, but he and his gangsters begin harassing her family, saying she's the one who owes him money. ==Cast== *Soo Ae as Jeong-eun *Joo Hyun as Ju-seok *Park Ji-bin as Jeong-hwan *Park Hee-soon as Chang-won *Uhm Tae-woong as Dong-su *Jung Wook as Byeong-cheon *Chu Gwi-jeong as beauty salon owner *Jeon Guk-hwan as Man-sik *Kim Se-dong as probation officer ==Awards and nominations== Year Award Category Recipient Result 2004 Blue Dragon Film Awards Best New Actress Soo Ae 2004 Blue Dragon Film Awards Best New Director Lee Jung-chul 2004 Korean Film Awards Best New Actor Park Hee-soon 2004 Korean Film Awards Best New Actress Soo Ae 2004 Director's Cut Awards Best New Actress Soo Ae 2004 Cine 21 Awards Best New Actress Soo Ae 2005 Max Movie Awards Best Actress Soo Ae 2005 Baeksang Arts Awards Best New Actress Soo Ae 2005 Grand Bell Awards Best New Actress Soo Ae 2005 Asia Pacific Film Festival Best Actor Joo Hyun ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:South Korean drama films Category:2004 films Category:2000s South Korean films
