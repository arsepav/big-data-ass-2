A Day in the Life of Bonnie and Clyde is a 1968 studio album by Mel Tormé. It was released during a wave of renewed interest in the crime duo Bonnie and Clyde following the release of the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde. With the exception of the title track, an original song by Tormé, the album mostly consists of covers of popular songs from the late 1920s and early 1930s, around the period when the real-life Bonnie and Clyde were committing their bank robberies. (Another exception is "I Concentrate on You", a Cole Porter song from 1940.) ==Track listing== == Personnel == * Mel Tormé – vocals * John Audino – trumpet * Buddy Childers * Frank Rosolino – trombone * Georgie Auld – saxophone * Bill Green * Dave Pell * Mike Deasy – guitar * Herb Ellis * Barney Kessel * Ray Pohlman – double bass * Eugene Dinovi – Hammond organ, piano * John Cyr – drums * Lincoln Mayorga – arranger ==References== Category:1968 albums Category:Mel Tormé albums Category:Liberty Records albums Category:Albums arranged by Lincoln Mayorga Category:Depictions of Bonnie and Clyde in music
