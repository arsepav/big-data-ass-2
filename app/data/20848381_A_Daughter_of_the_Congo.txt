Since silent films were considered to have little commercial value in 1930, Micheaux released the film as a “talking, singing, dancing picture” – although it only contained a single short sound sequence that included a performance of the song “That Gets It” by Roland Irving and Earl B. Westfield.“Film and Authorship” by Virginia Wright Wexman, Google Books“Within Our Gates” by Alan Gevinson, American Film Institute Noisette had previously starred in Micheaux’s 1929 When Men Betray and worked for him again in his first sound film, The Exile (1931).“Biography: Katherine Noisette,” Turner Classic Movies Tucker, who also appeared in Micheaux’s films, was promoted as a “black Valentino” because of his good looks and dashing on- screen persona.“Lorenzo Tucker Dies; Stage and Screen Actor,” New York Times, August 30, 1986 ==Criticism== A Daughter of the Congo received severe criticism from Theophilus Lewis, a columnist with the Amsterdam News, an African-American weekly newspaper in New York City. Lewis took Micheaux to task for his presentation of African society and for perceived racism in the cast through his selection of actors by skin color. Lewis wrote: "The scene is laid in a not so mythical republic in Africa. Half of the characters wear European clothes and are supposed to be civilized, while the other half wear their birthday suits and some feathers and are supposed to be savages. All the noble characters are high yellows; all the ignoble ones are black. It is based on a false assumption that has no connection with the realities of life." ==See also== *List of lost films ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1930 films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Oscar Micheaux Category:Lost American films Category:American silent feature films Category:Race films Category:American adventure films Category:1930 adventure films Category:1930s American films Category:Silent adventure films
