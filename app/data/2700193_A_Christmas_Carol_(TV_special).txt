It starred Alastair Sim as the voice of Ebenezer Scrooge â€” a role Sim had previously performed in the 1951 live-action film Scrooge. Michael Hordern likewise reprised his 1951 performance as Marley's Ghost in the animated film. Michael Redgrave narrated the story and veteran Looney Tunes animator Chuck Jones served as executive producer. Williams' son Alexander Williams, then aged four, provided the voice for Tiny Tim. Animation for the film was created by multiple pans and zooms and unexpected scene transitions. The visual style was inspired by 19th-century engraved illustrations of the original story by John Leech and the pen and ink renderings by illustrator Milo Winter that illustrated the 1930s editions of the book. The film's bleak mood and emphasis on darkness and shadows led some to consider it the most frightening of the many dramatizations of the Dickens classic. ==Reception and legacy== Originally produced as a 1971 television special, the quality of the animation on A Christmas Carol was considered so high that it was subsequently released theatrically, thereby rendering it eligible for Oscar consideration, and the film won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film one year later. Some industry insiders took issue that a short originally shown on television was given the award, and the Academy responded by changing its policy, disqualifying any future works initially shown on television eligibility. ==See also== * List of Christmas films * List of American films of 1971 * List of British films of 1971 * List of ghost films * List of adaptations of A Christmas Carol ==References== ==External links== * * * A Christmas Carol (1971) on YouTube * Cels from the Ken Harris website * Tiny Tim remembered at FLIP Animation Magazine Retrieved January 2013 Category:1971 films Category:1971 animated films Category:1971 short films Category:1971 television specials Category:1972 films Category:1972 animated films Category:1972 short films Category:1970s American television specials Category:1970s animated short films Category:1970s fantasy films Category:American animated short films Category:American Broadcasting Company television specials Category:American Christmas films Category:British Christmas films Category:Animated Christmas films Category:Animated films based on novels Category:1970s animated television specials Category:Best Animated Short Academy Award winners Category:Films based on A Christmas Carol Category:Films directed by Richard Williams Category:1970s Christmas films Category:American Christmas television specials Category:Animated Christmas television specials Category:Films produced by Richard Williams (animator) Category:1970s English-language films Category:1970s American films Category:1970s British films Category:Films set in 1843 Category:Films set in the 1840s
