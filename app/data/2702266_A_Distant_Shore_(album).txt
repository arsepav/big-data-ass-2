We’ve lived so long with melodrama that we’ve forgotten there are other ways of showing passion." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from liner notes. * Tracey Thorn – vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar * Pat Bermingham – recording * Jane Fox – cover drawing ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1982 debut albums Category:Tracey Thorn albums Category:Cherry Red Records albums
