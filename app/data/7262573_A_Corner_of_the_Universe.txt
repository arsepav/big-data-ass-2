She's looking forward to helping her mother Dorothy run their boarding house with its eccentric adult boarders, painting alongside her father Jonathan, and reading. Then 21-year-old Uncle Adam, whom Hattie never knew existed, comes to stay with Hattie's grandparents (Nana and Papa), because his "school," an institution for the mentally disabled, has closed down permanently. Intelligent, childlike, and strange owing to his disability, Adam visits Hattie often. Adam quickly becomes smitten with Angel Valentine, the beautiful and most recent lodger to check into the Owen boardinghouse. Hattie then meets Leila, the daughter of the carnival owners who come to town. However, after Adam suffers a mental breakdown on the Ferris wheel, she moves away with the carnival. Throughout the summer, other people come to stay at Hattie's boarding house, such as a woman with a son and daughter who recently suffered the death of her husband and moved away, but needed a place to stay while job hunting. As various other events mark Hattie's "uneventful" summer, she comes to better understand Adam. But when Adam dies by suicide after seeing Angel sleeping with her new boyfriend, it leads everyone—including Hattie—to realize that none of them had understood Adam as much as he needed them to. == Sources cited == Category:2002 American novels Category:American children's novels Category:Newbery Honor-winning works Category:Novels set in the 1960s Category:2002 children's books Category:Children's books set in the 1960s
