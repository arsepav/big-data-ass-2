Contrary to the experiences of many local filmmakers, authorities were keen to give the producers permission to film in public places. A shoot out was filmed in Martin Place during Sydney's rush hour which caused a commotion, and leading to two extras being injured.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 112.
