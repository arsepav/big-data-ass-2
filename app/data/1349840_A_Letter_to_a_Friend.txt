A Letter to a Friend (written 1656; published posthumously in 1690), by Sir Thomas Browne, the 17th century philosopher and physician, is a medical treatise of case-histories and witty speculations upon the human condition. ==Morgellons== It is believed to be the source of a term Mary Leitao found in 2001 to describe her son's skin condition. She chose the name "Morgellons disease" from a skin condition described by Browne in Letter to a Friend,"The Major Works of Sir Thomas Browne", edited and with an Introduction by C. A. Partides. Penguin 1977 thus: There is, however, no suggestion that the symptoms described by Browne are linked to the alleged modern cases of Morgellons. In 1935, Charles Ernest Kellett MD FRCP (1903-1978), who lectured in the history of medicine at the University of Newcastle medical school, wrote a detailed criticism of Browne's Morgellons reference. ==References== ==External links== *Full text with comments Category:1656 books Category:1690 books Category:Works by Thomas Browne Category:Books published posthumously Category:Treatises Category:Medical books Category:Delusional parasitosis
