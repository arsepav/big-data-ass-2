Ofcom ruled that there was no rule banning the showing of genuine sexual acts on free-to- air television, and that "in [their] view the portrayal of sex in this programme genuinely sought to inform and educate on sex", concluding that "whilst the visuals were explicit at times, nothing was transmitted in a manner that could be construed as having the potential to harm people under the age of 18", particularly given its context as a serious factual programme, and as such, it was ruled that the episodes were not in breach of any broadcasting regulations. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2000s British documentary television series Category:2006 British television series debuts Category:2006 British television series endings Category:British television documentaries Category:Channel 5 documentary series Category:Sex education television series Category:Obscenity controversies in television Category:Television series by Endemol Category:Sex education in the United Kingdom Category:Television controversies in the United Kingdom
