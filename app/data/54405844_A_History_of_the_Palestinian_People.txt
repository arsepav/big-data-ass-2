A History of the Palestinian People: From Ancient Times to the Modern Era is an empty book by Assaf Voll that uses blank pages to suggest that Palestinians have no history, based on a false argument that a group may only call itself "a people" if it has always existed. It has continued to circulate on social media among the Israeli right-wing. It was published in paperback and digital formats in 2017, and most of its contents are blank pages. The book rose in Amazon.com's best-selling titles in the category of "Israel and Palestine History", reaching second place before it was pulled from sale by Amazon. Its publication has been described as a "cruel joke". The incident has been said to signify "the continued vitality of a more enduring political, social and cultural impulse to abrogate Palestinian history and identity – on the part of Israel, and by extension, among its Western allies." ==Contents summary== Besides the front cover, back cover, and title page the book contains a quote attributed to the Seinfeld character George Costanza: "Just remember, it's not a lie if you believe it." The rest of its pages are blank. The Hebrew version of 120 pages is shorter than the 132-page English version. Voll said that a planned German version will be significantly longer. ==Composition and publication== Voll is a columnist for Israeli publications, and involved in public relations and advertising. Holding an M.A. in Jewish Studies from Haifa University, Voll has also lectured at the university as an external lecturer. The book was described by its author as "a fruit of many years of research" and "the most comprehensive and extensive review of some 3,000 years of Palestinian history, with emphasis on the Palestinian people's unique contribution to the world and to humanity". Interviewed on the Kol Chai radio station, Voll stated that "The Palestinian people believe they are a people, and someone needs to tell them the truth even if it hurts. Look what happens when they were given the feeling that they are a real people."The Secret Behind Bestseller on Palestinian History , JPost, Joy Bernard, June 21, 2017New Book On Palestinian History: 120 Blank Pages , Breaking News Israel, Adam Eliyahu Berkowitz, June 19, 2017New Israeli Book: the History of the Palestinian People (in Hebrew) , Mako, Ehud Kinan, 19 June 2017For Sale: Palestinian History Book – with Empty Pages , nrg news, 19 June 2017 ==Reception== ===Support=== Promoted by American weekly The Jewish Press, the book also received positive user reviews and rankings.

In a column published by Mondoweiss, Jonathan Cook wrote that the book had antecedents, in 1969, Golda Meir declared to the world: "There was no such thing as Palestinians" and that in 1984 the book From Time Immemorial claimed Palestinians were recent economically motivated immigrants. Furthermore, Cook wrote "Israelis have been only too happy to make the Palestinians vanish."Cook, Jonathan Israel's efforts to hide Palestinians from view no longer fools young American Jews , Mondoweiss, 27 June 2017 Joshua Shanes writing in Haaretz said that nations are a result of modernity and that "no nation—as we currently understand and use the term—dates to antiquity, not even the Jews." According to Shanes the formation of Palestinian nationhood occurred lockstep with the formation of Jewish nationhood in the 19th century, but this does not say either are "invented" and that in any event the Palestinians today, regardless of their historical origin, are a nation. An attempt to deny the existence of the opposing side is a path to irreconcilable conflict. In a separate review on Haaretz it was claimed that "The author's argument that the Palestinians are not a people because they are void of history isn't new – it's a mainstay of the Israeli right". In an article in The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, Professor Steven Weitzman of the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies said that Voll's book is Shlomo Sand's The Invention of the Jewish People argument in reverse applied to Palestinians instead of Jews. Weitzman further said "What was offensive about the book is that it is completely blank, the author's way of arguing that the Palestinians are not a real people and have no real history—an argument that other scholars have made in more conventional ways".The Origins of the Jews exchange, part 2: On the gaps between the Jewish public and the scholars , The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, Shmuel Rosner, 5 July 2017] Ahmed Dabesh in Lebanese daily Al Akhbar wrote that Voll didn't mention that the "Zionist entity" was born out of aggression against the Palestinians and the rape of their land, attacked the Zionist Archaeology policy, and asserted that the Palestinians have roots dating back until at least the Stone Age, 4000 BCE (sic).Palestinians in Empty Pages (Arabic) , Ahmed Dabesh, 3 July 2017 Conversely, on Arab News Network it was claimed the Palestinians have Canaanite roots dating back at least 4500 years, and that the book is an unsuccessful response to the Occupied Palestine Resolution in UNESCO.Israeli Presents Empty Book on Palestinians in Amazon (Arabic) , ANN, June 2017 A review in Al-Modon said that Israel is empty as the book is empty, that the book is part of continuing Zionist methodology of claiming that Palestine is a land without a people, the same methodology that led the Zionists to steal the Palestinian cuisine and claim worldwide that hummus and falafel are Israeli inventions.The Book is Empty...
