73663265	A Grande Conquista	A Grande Conquista (English: The Great Conquest) is a Brazilian reality competition format originally created and aired by RecordTV and hosted by Mariana Rios. The series premiered on Monday, May 8, 2023, at (BRT / AMT), following a special preview episode that aired on May 2. Originally billed as the Super Reality, the show features famous celebrities and ordinary civilians living together in a Mansion isolated from the outside world, while competing in challenges to avoid being nominated and, subsequently, evicted by the public in order to win the grand prize of R$1.000.000. ==Format== ===Stage 1=== Before the premiere, 16 celebrities compete in a public vote for the first 10 spots (5 men and 5 women) in the Mansion. The 6 who receive the fewest votes move into the Villa to compete with another 64 candidates (including both celebrities and civilians) for the remaining 10 spots, bringing the total number of contestants up to 20. {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; font-size:100%; width:100%; line-height:13px;" Candidate Occupation Result Ref.
