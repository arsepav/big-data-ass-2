13957824	A Child's Adventure	A Child's Adventure is the tenth album by British singer Marianne Faithfull, released on Island Records in 1983. ==Background and recording== After two albums with Mark Mundy as producer, Marianne Faithfull recorded A Child's Adventure without a separate producer; the album was produced by backing musicians Wally Badarou and Barry Reynolds and engineer Harvey Goldberg. In an interview following the album's recording, she remarked, "On this album, because we didn't have a producer as such, we could really work closely together on the finer bits - the harmonics, which a producer often doesn't have the time for." Faithfull had been performing "She's Got a Problem", a poem written by Caroline Blackwood and put to music by Faithfull's then- husband Ben Brierley, since 1978. == Track listing == ==Personnel== * Marianne Faithfull – vocals * Barry Reynolds – vocals, guitar * Ben Brierley – vocals, guitar * Wally Badarou – vocals, keyboards * Mikey Chung – guitar * Fernando Saunders – bass * Terry Stannard – drums * Rafael de Jesus – percussion ==Charts== Chart (1983) Peak position ==References== Category:1983 albums Category:Marianne Faithfull albums Category:Albums produced by Wally Badarou Category:Island Records albums
