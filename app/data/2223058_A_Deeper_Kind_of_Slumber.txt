2223058	A Deeper Kind of Slumber	A Deeper Kind of Slumber is the fifth studio album from Swedish band Tiamat. Featuring female background vocals by Birgit Zacher (Moonspell, Angel Dust) and experimentation with a variety of influences, the album marked the group's first complete withdrawal from both death metal and conventional heavy metal, following their 1994 release, Wildhoney. It was also the first production after their relocation to Germany, and was written almost entirely by founder/lead songwriter Johan Edlund. Much of the music had reflected on Edlund's personal relationship with drugs, creative differences within the band as well as an interpersonal relationship. == Track listing == ==Credits== ===Tiamat=== *Johan Edlund – vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards, theremin, co- production *Thomas Petersson – electric and acoustic guitars *Anders Iwers – bass guitar *Lars Sköld – drums ===Additional personnel=== *The Inchtabokatables – violin, cello *Sami Yli-Sirniö – sitar *Ertugrul Coruk – flute *Anke Eilhardt – Oboe *Birgit Zacher – additional vocals *Dirk Draeger – keyboards, engineering, production *Siggi Bemm – engineering, mixing, mastering ==Charts== Chart (1997) Peak position Swedish Albums Chart 39 ==References== Category:1997 albums Category:Tiamat (band) albums Category:Symphonic rock albums
