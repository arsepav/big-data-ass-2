The investigation is entrusted to a young detective named Bekzat, although local criminal bosses indicate they do not want the investigation to progress, with the police already finding a suspect - an intellectually disabled man named Pukuar, whom Bekzat is tasked to kill. However, a journalist named Ariana soon arrives in Karatas to observe the investigation, ruining Bekzat's plans. She points out that this is the fourth such murder, and previous victims had similar traits - they are small orphan boys; she does not believe that Pukuar could be the murderer and has Bekzat actually investigate the murder. Unwillingly going deeper into the investigation, Bekzat understands that the murderer is actually one of the local criminal kingpins, who then murders the chief of police and tells Bekzat to tie up loose ends, with Ariana eventually beaten up and framed of drug possession, however, Bekzat has changed, and eventually decides to leave Pukuar and his friend at his friend's house in the mountains for their safety, then going on a killing spree.
