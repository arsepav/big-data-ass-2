19389514	A Lad an' a Lamp	A Lad an' a Lamp is a 1932 Our Gang short comedy film directed by Robert F. McGowan. It was the 119th (32nd talking episode) Our Gang short that was released. The film has been criticized as containing racist humor. ==Plot== Fascinated by the story of Aladdin and his magic lamp, the gang gather together with several gasoline and kerosene lamps and lanterns and a few electric lamps hoping that by rubbing them vigorously, a genie will appear. Thanks to a series of coincidences—not least of which involves a friendly stage magician—the kids become convinced that they have succeeded in invoking Aladdin. But their excitement turns to dismay when Stymie believes Spanky has transformed his kid brother Cotton into a monkey (chimpanzee). ==Cast== ===The Gang=== * Matthew Beard as Stymie * Dorothy DeBorba as Dorothy * Bobby Hutchins as Wheezer * George McFarland as Spanky * Dickie Moore as Dick * Bobbie Beard as Cotton * Georgie Billings as Georgie * Dickie Jackson as Dickie * John Collum as Uh-huh * Bobby DeWar as Our Gang member * Henry Hanna as Our Gang member * Pete the Pup as himself ===Additional cast=== * Donald Haines as Toughie * Harry Bernard as Officer / Store proprietor (scene deleted) * Dick Gilbert as Officer / Dick, construction worker * Jack Hill as Audience member / Officer * Florence Hoskins as Cook's girlfriend * James C.

For this reason, A Lad an' a Lamp has been withdrawn from the "Little Rascals" television package. It is currently available in its entirety on VHS and DVD. ==See also== * Our Gang filmography ==References== ==External links== * Category:1932 films Category:American black-and-white films Category:1932 comedy films Category:Films directed by Robert F.
