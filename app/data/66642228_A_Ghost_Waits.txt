In the strip a woman says that the most American film is Ghostbusters, as "in it there's undeniable proof of an afterlife but the whole thing is about growing a small business and navigating bureaucracy", which Stovall found humorous. He began working on the script in January 2016 and by July of the same year, began filming. While editing the assembly cut Stovall noted that the first act needed to be stronger, so he and lead actor MacLeod Andrews flew to Cincinnati to determine what needed to be fixed before performing reshoots in February 2018. A Ghost Waits was initially filmed in color per the recommendation of the unit production manager. Andrews suggested making the film black and white, a concept that Stovall had entertained early in the production process. Per Stovall, this made it easier for the footage to match up properly, as he was using material shot during different points in the production process and by two different people. ==Reception== Critical reception for A Ghost Waits has been positive and the film holds a rating of on Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews. Some reviewers have drawn comparisons between the film and the 1988 film Beetlejuice, as A Ghost Waits has a "kind of afterlife bureaucracy in charge of hauntings". Other elements of praise focused on the movie's characters and use of greyscale. Kim Newman reviewed the movie favorably, stating "Itâ€™s rare for a screen character to express any satisfaction in doing a blue-collar job well, for instance, and this makes an interesting contrast with Girl on the Third Floor, in which the handyman is amateur and inept and provokes a female ghost to wrath rather than sympathy." Flickering Myth gave the film three stars, writing that "Its storytelling inconsistencies accepted, this is an impressive effort given the resources". ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2020 films Category:2020 comedy horror films Category:2020 romantic comedy films Category:Haunted house films Category:2020s English-language films Category:American ghost films Category:2020s ghost films
