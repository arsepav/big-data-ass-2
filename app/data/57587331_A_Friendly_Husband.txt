When he arrives home, he discovers that her mother (Thatcher) has collected her brood and come to pay a visit. They all immediately pile into the car and start off for a nice cool place in the country, leaving the husband to walk behind them. The camping outfit has every convenience and is worked by push buttons. While Tootsie, her mother, and the rest of the family are enjoying the outing, Friend Husband is left with all of the work. The mischievous younger brother of the wife insists on playing with the buttons and beds, chairs, and tables that work off hinges swing wildly through the air. Later, a band of robbers attack them, but Friend Husband finally captures them all and receives an award. Through this he gains the respect of his Mother-in-law and the renewed assurances of his wife's affection. ==Cast== *Lupino Lane as Friend Husband *Alberta Vaughn as Tootsie, Friend Wife *Eva Thatcher as Mother-in-law ==Preservation== A print of A Friendly Husband with Czech intertitles survives at the Museum of Modern Art.American Silent Feature Film Survival Database: A Friendly Husband ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1923 comedy films Category:Silent American comedy films Category:1923 films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Fox Film films Category:Films directed by John G.
