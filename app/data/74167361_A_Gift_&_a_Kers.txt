The album marks Kerser's first number- one album in Australia. ==Background== Kerser had expressed a desire to record 10 albums in 10 years, but his plan was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed him three years to finish his final album rather than his usual four-month period between touring. Kerser stated: "I honestly feel like I reached my full potential on this album." He also said, "I feel like I covered every Kers style, so it really takes the fans on a journey. [...] My final thank you and my final imprint on the scene I built." ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart performance for A Gift & a Kers Chart (2023) Peak position Australian Albums (ARIA) 1 ==References== Category:2023 albums Category:Kerser albums Category:Warner Music Australia albums
