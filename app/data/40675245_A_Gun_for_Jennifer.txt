A Gun for Jennifer is a 1997 rape and revenge film thriller film directed by Todd Morris and starring Deborah Twiss. It follows a feminist vigilante group who castrate suspected rapists and batterers while a female police officer attempts to stop them. It is shot in a retro grindhouse style and premiered at the Fantasia Festival in July 1997, where it was sold-out an hour before screening and received a standing ovation. The film has not left the festival circuit; Fangoria reported that it had been picked up for distribution by Mondo Macabro, but the release never came to fruition. The movie was covered in the documentary In the Belly of the Beast, which detailed Morris and Twiss's discovery that their financier (whom Twiss had met while working as an exotic dancer) had been embezzling money. ==Cast== *Deborah Twiss as Jennifer / Allison *Benja Kay as Dt.
