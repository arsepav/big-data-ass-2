A Lil' Light is a studio album by American rapper Dudley Perkins. It was released via Stones Throw Records on July 15, 2003. The album is entirely produced by Madlib. ==Critical reception== Eric K. Arnold of East Bay Express gave the album a favorable review, saying: "Producer Madlib's touch is evident in the album's schizophrenic mix of voices, weird arrangements, and esoteric musical elements, but there's no denying the emotional quotient that's missing from above-ground rap is alive and well here." David Morris of PopMatters said: "Aside from how enjoyable it is in and of itself, A Lil' Light also opens up new possibilities for R&B;, brushing off both the pure gloss of the mainstream and the predictable over-emoting of neo-soul in favor of something more bracingly real." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from liner notes. * Dudley Perkins – vocals, lyrics, melodies, intro recording, interlude recording * Madlib – production, intro recording, interlude recording, recording (11) * David Lona a.k.a.
