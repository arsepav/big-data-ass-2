The painting hung in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts, prior to being one of 13 works stolen from the museum in a 1990 theft. ==Provenance== The authorship of the painting has been debated. In 1987, the Rembrandt Research Project (RRP) disattributed the work, considering it a product of the artist's workshop. However, the RRP re- attributed the painting to Rembrandt again in its corpus published in 2015, in which it is called Portrait of a couple in an interior. X-ray examination of the painting reveals that Rembrandt originally painted a child leaning on the seated lady's leg. Art historians speculate that the child died young and that the couple asked for the image to be painted out so as not to bring back painful memories.A Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings VI: Rembrandt’s Paintings Revisited – A Complete Survey.
