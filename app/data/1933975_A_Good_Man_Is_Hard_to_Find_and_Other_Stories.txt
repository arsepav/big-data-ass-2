The collection was first published in 1955. The subjects of the short stories range from baptism ("The River") to serial killers ("A Good Man Is Hard to Find") to human greed and exploitation ("The Life You Save May Be Your Own"). The majority of the stories include jarring violent scenes that make the characters undergo a spiritual change. The short stories commonly have tones of Catholicism related to life and death scenarios. For instance, in the story "A Good Man Is Hard To Find" the villain states, "She would have been a good woman if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life." ==Contents== It contains the following stories: *"A Good Man Is Hard to Find" *"The River" *"The Life You Save May Be Your Own" *"A Stroke of Good Fortune" *"A Temple of the Holy Ghost" *"The Artificial Nigger" *"A Circle in the Fire" *"A Late Encounter with the Enemy" *"Good Country People" *"The Displaced Person" ==Title== thumb|150px|The title comes from a 1920s blues song.
