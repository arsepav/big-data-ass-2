A Collection is a greatest hits album by Third Eye Blind, released July 18, 2006. The album contains all of their singles (with the exception of "Anything"), a handful of fan and band favorites, as well as three unreleased- via-LP songs: "Tattoo of the Sun", "My Time in Exile" and "Slow Motion" (with lyrics). The package also includes liner notes from renowned rock writer James Hunter and track-by-track commentary from Stephan Jenkins. ==Critical reception== Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic was critical of the length of the album, commenting that the album captures Third Eye Blind's "early way with a hook as skillfully as their descent into unbearable pomposity". ==Commercial performance== A Collection peaked at #103 on the Billboard 200, staying on the chart for three weeks. ==Track listing== == Rejected options == An acoustic version of "Anything" (the only single that did not make the cut) was replaced by "Can't Get Away", likely due to its short-length and to even the number of songs from each album. Remixes of "Losing a Whole Year" and "Graduate" and a 1995 demo of "Semi-Charmed Life" were dropped in favor of the original studio recordings, likely done in order to appeal to a traditional audience. The track list was also in a different order: # "Semi-Charmed Life (1995 Demo)" # "Losing A Whole Year (Remix - Strings Up)" # "How's It Going To Be" # "Jumper" # "Graduate (Remix)" # "Tattoo Of The Sun" # "Never Let You Go" # "Deep Inside Of You" # "Anything (Acoustic)" # "10 Days Late" # "Blinded" # "Crystal Baller" # "My Time In Exile" # "God Of Wine" # "Motorcycle Drive By" # "Forget Myself" # "Wounded" # "Palm Reader" # "Slow Motion (With Lyrics)" == References == Category:Third Eye Blind albums Category:2006 compilation albums Category:2006 greatest hits albums Category:Rhino Records compilation albums
