22944422	A Great Way to Care	A Great Way To Care is a Hong Kong medical crime drama television series produced by Marco Law and TVB. It stars Alex Fong as Dr. Ko Lap-yan, a senior psychiatrist who has a specialty in diagnosing mentally ill criminals. Produced in 2008, the first series premiered on Malaysia's AOD on 8 June 2009. Originally scheduled for a summer 2009 release in Hong Kong, the broadcast of the series was put on hold after the success of Lee Tim-sing's period serial, Rosy Business. Lee's sister production, Sweetness in the Salt, was aired in place of A Great Way to Care. With a total of 20 episodes, the series finally premiered on Jade in Hong Kong on 10 January 2011. A sequel series of 25 episodes was renewed in early 2012, and premiered on TVB's Jade and HD Jade channels on 18 March 2013. ==Series overview== Dr. Ko Lap-yan heads a team of senior psychiatrists and residents at the Yan Wo Hospital in Hong Kong. Most episodes revolve around the team diagnosing patients. With a specialty at diagnosing criminals, Ko also has close ties with the Serious Crime Unit of the Hong Kong Police Force, a unit headed by Senior Inspector Chung Kwon-ban. The second series sees Ko's resignation from the Yan Wo Hospital; he is later transferred to a new psychiatric department, the Forensics Psychiatry Department, of Bok On Hospital, where he formally diagnoses criminals. ==Cast and characters== Name Portrayed by Occupation Series 1 2 Dr. Ko Lap-yan Alex Fong Senior Psychiatrist, Yan Wo's Department of Psychiatry (1) Consultant Psychiatrist, Bok On's Department of Forensics Psychiatry (2) Main SIP Chung Kwok-ban Ben Wong Senior Inspector of Police at HKPF Serious Crime Unit Main Dr. Sam C.S.
