Bildner has noted that he knows "it won’t be the last time it happens." He hopes parents and schools will continue advocating for books like A High Five for Glenn Burke, especially when they work with middle school students because "[t]hese kids are trying to figure out who they are and where they fit in, and they need to know a book like this exists." He continued, noting that "Tragically, when you erase LGBTQ books and eliminate access to them, you erase these kids and their narratives. And, when you do this, lives are at stake. These kids need to know that their stories and their lives, matter. Teachers and librarians need to be caretakers—not gatekeepers—to create a safe space for all kids." == References == Category:2020 children's books Category:2020s LGBT novels Category:2020 LGBT- related literary works Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books Category:Baseball novels Category:Children's books about baseball Category:Children's books about African-American history Category:Children's books with LGBT themes Category:2020 American novels Category:American children's novels
