After a brief courtship, Frank proposes to Vera. It is suggested Graham move out of his childhood home and into a hostel. Frank is hiding a secret: he is already married and, despite this, has already proposed to various women before Vera. When Graham finds out, he is vastly relieved and triumphantly confronts his mother with the information. Her hopes of happiness are destroyed, but a safe, stultifying "normality" has been restored in the existence of Graham and his mother. ==Reception== Many have praised Bennett's portrayal of the character of Graham.
