It was thus aimed squarely at women. The book was actually a collective effort: the preface states that "a Number of very Curious and Delicate House-wives Clubb'd to furnish out this Collection". The book contains an early recipe for suet pudding, and the first printed recipe for orange marmalade,Kettilby, pages 78â€“79 though without the chunks typically used now. (cited in The Independent) ===Contents=== thumb|Recipes for "Tansy" and "Hogs-Puddings" The book is divided into chapters for food and chapters for remedies. Page numbers apply to the 5th edition. ; [Part I] * A Collection of Receipts in Cookery, &c.; 9 * A Collection of Receipts in Physick and Surgery 99 * Index ; Part II * A Collection of Receipts in Cookery, &c.; 193 * A Collection of Receipts in Physick and Surgery 233 * Index ===Approach=== Apart from the Preface, there is no introduction of any sort: the recipes follow immediately after the chapter headings. The book is clearly divided into chapters of recipes for food and for remedies, but within the chapters there is no definite structure. For example, the first chapter begins with six recipes for soups, followed by recipes for collared beef, "French-Cutlets", collared mutton, stewed pigeons, broiled pigeons, dressed turbot, and then patties "for a Dish of Fish". While some logic may be discerned in this ordering, readers need to refer to the index to locate any particular dish. The recipes are given either as goals, as "To make Hogs-Puddings", or as titles, sometimes with descriptions, as "A very good Tansy".Kettilby, page 54. Quantities are given in whichever units are convenient, as "a Gallon of grated Bread", "three Pounds of Currants", or "nine Eggs". Often, quantities rely on the cook's judgement, as "as much Sugar as will make it very sweet". Temperatures and timings are given when necessary, as "a cool Oven: Half an Hour bakes it." There are no lists of ingredients. ===Editions=== The following editions are known.
