Adler states: "The music is intense and challenging, but it has a certain airiness." The Penguin Guide to Jazz thought that the "reunion with Maneri sparks off a lot of shared experience, and their interaction, notably on the duo 'Renascent', is close, intelligent and thoroughly sympathetic." The JazzTimes review by Harvey Pekar noted: "Morris' solos have an angular quality. He plays both flurries of notes and spare phrases during which he's thinking from interval to interval, trying to make the shape of his lines as distinctive as possible."Pekar, Harvey.
