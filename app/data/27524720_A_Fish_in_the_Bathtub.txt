27524720	A Fish in the Bathtub	A Fish in the Bathtub is a 1999 comedy film directed by Joan Micklin Silver. It stars real life couple Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara play Sam and Molly, a married husband and wife whose marriage has been stretched to the brink after 40 years of incessant bickering over the smallest of things, not the least of which is Sam's inexplicable decision to keep a fish in the bathtub. This, along with a daily harangue from the cantankerous Sam, forces Molly to finally pack a bag and go to son Joel's home, which sets the stage for the family to fight through this bump in the road and get life back on track. The film has been generally poorly received. Contact Music referred to it as "Just not that humorous". The New York Times criticized the film's dialogue, stating that "...the bickering goes too far..." Killer Movies referred to its plot as "...nothing particularly new or significant or eye- popping..." ==Cast== * Jerry Stiller as Sam * Anne Meara as Molly * Mark Ruffalo as Joel * Jane Adams as Ruthie * Doris Roberts as Freida * Louis Zorich as Morris * Phyllis Newman as Sylvia Rosen * Val Avery as Abe * Bob Dishy as Lou Moskowitz * Mordecai Lawner as Bernie * Peter McRobbie as Father Malaccky * Jonathan Hogan as Eldon Krantz * Elizabeth Franz as Bea Greenberg ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990s American films Category:1990s English-language films Category:1999 films Category:1999 independent films Category:1999 romantic comedy-drama films Category:American independent films Category:American romantic comedy-drama films Category:Films directed by Joan Micklin Silver Category:Films shot in New York City
