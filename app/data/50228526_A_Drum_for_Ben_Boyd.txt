Possessing either unlimited wealth or unlimited credit, he invaded the financial system of the colony with amazing ease, winning over many incautious speculators, founding banks, and actually building his own town at Twofold Bay. His brief career almost ended in bankruptcy, and finally he disappeared on a lone shooting expedition at Guadalcanal. The Oberon, chartered to discover some trace of him, returned with a skull, which was later proved to be that of a native." ==Critical reception== A reviewer in The Advertiser stated: "Francis Webb's method is to gather a set of characters together and — with little of his own narrative — allow them to speak their impressions of Boyd. The result is an entertaining hotch-potch, with a current of serious and imaginative thought. The poetry is free and modern in sound, without eccentricity. It reads plainly, but has excitement and vigor..""Attractive Series of Poems", The Advertiser, 12 June 1948, p6 The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer was impressed by the work: "Every person in the narrative sequence speaks with the colour of his type. Characterisation is more difficult in poetry than in prose, but Webb has presented each of them splendidly and from them built the significance of'fhe greater character of Boyd.""Of Boyd and the Sea" by S.H.O'L, The Sydney Morning Herald, 3 July 1948, p8 ==Awards== * 1948 - winner Grace Leven Prize for Poetry ==See also== * 1948 in literature * 1948 in Australian literature ==References== Category:Australian poems Category:1948 books Category:Angus & Robertson books Category:1948 poems Category:Epic poems in English
