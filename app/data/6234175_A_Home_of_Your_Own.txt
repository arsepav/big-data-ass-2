A Home of Your Own is a 1964 British comedy film, which is a brick-by-brick account of the building of a young couple's dream house. From the day when the site is first selected, to the day – several years and children later – when the couple finally move in, the story is a noisy but wordless comedy of errors, as the incompetent labourers struggle to complete the house. In the 2006 interview included on the DVD's box set release, the Producer said the film's idea was not his own, but came from a comic idea to "De-prestige" a building company's vainglorious promotional film he and the Writers had watched. In this satirical look at British builders, many cups of tea are made, windows are broken and the same section of road is dug up over and over again by the water board, the electricity board and the gas board. Ronnie Barker's repeatedly ruined cementing; Peter Butterworth's short-sighted carpenter, and Bernard Cribbins’ hapless stonemason all contribute to the ensuing chaos. The film was released on Blu-ray in 2021 as part of Futtocks End and Other Short Stories, an anthology of short films produced by Kellet, also including San Ferry Ann and Vive le Sport. ==Cast== *Ronnie Barker as the Cement Mixer *Richard Briers as the Husband *Peter Butterworth as the Carpenter *Bernard Cribbins as the Stonemason *Bill Fraser as the Shop Steward *Norman Mitchell as the Foreman *Ronnie Stevens as the Architect *Fred Emney as the Mayor Also starring *Janet Brown *Gerald Campion *Bridget Armstrong *George Benson *Douglas Ives *Jack Melford *Thelma Ruby *Tony Tanner *Aubrey Woods *Helen Cotterill *Barrie Gosney *Harry Locke *Thorley Walters *Henry Woolf == External links == * * Category:1964 films Category:British comedy films Category:1964 comedy films Category:1960s British films
