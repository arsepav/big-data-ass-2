Thomas C. Kennedy said in his review for Motography (1916) that "one finds many really humorous moments, and the picture tells a story that is always interesting; in fact, a story with such continuity as this one has is quite unusual in farce of the Keystone type". Kennedy praised the actor's performances, highlighting Gribbon's leading role saying, he "wins the acting honors". ==References== ==External links== * Category:1916 films Category:1916 comedy films Category:1916 short films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Silent American comedy films Category:Films directed by Charley Chase Category:Films produced by Mack Sennett Category:Keystone Studios films Category:1910s American films Category:1910s English-language films Category:American comedy short films
