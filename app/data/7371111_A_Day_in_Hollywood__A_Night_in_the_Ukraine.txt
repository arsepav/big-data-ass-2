7371111	A Day in Hollywood / A Night in the Ukraine	A Day in Hollywood / A Night in the Ukraine is a musical comedy consisting of two essentially independent one-act plays, with a book and lyrics by Dick Vosburgh and music by Frank Lazarus. Additionally, songs by other composers are incorporated into the score. The musical premiered in the West End and then ran on Broadway. ==Plot overview== The first act, A Day in Hollywood, is a revue of classic Hollywood songs of the 1930s performed by singers and dancers representing ushers from Grauman's Chinese Theatre. The second, A Night in the Ukraine, is loosely based on Anton Chekhov's one-act play The Bear, and is presented in the style of a Marx Brothers movie. We follow Serge B. Samovar, a lawyer based on Groucho Marx, as he attempts to collect a 1,800 ruble fee from Mrs. Pavlenko – a wealthy widow. Other characters in this act include Gino (a Harpo Marx-inspired character), Carlo (a Chico Marx-inspired character), Nina, and Constantine (arguably a character inspired by Zeppo Marx). In a review of a regional production the reviewer from The New York Times commented that the musical "...has a hybrid score that lists music by Frank Lazarus, with book and lyrics by Dick Vosburgh, additional songs composed by Jerry Herman and a solid midsection medley devoted to the prolific composer of popular movie music, Richard A. Whiting. We are treated to a pleasant musical grab bag..."Klein, Alvin. "Theater; 'Day In Hollywood' In Fairfield", The New York Times, October 4, 1987 ==Productions== The musical premiered in the West End at the Mayfair Theatre on 28 March 1979, where it ran for 168 performances.

Day & Night Co., 523 F. Supp. 485 (S.D.N.Y. 1981). A lawyer for the plaintiffs said that they were not seeking to shut down the production, but only to demand a license fee for the use of the Marx Brothers characters. The District Court found in favor of the Marx heirs, applying New York law. However, on appeal, the decision was reversed, on the grounds that the Marx Brothers had been residents of California, and, at the time of the lawsuit, California law provided that a person's right of publicity either expired upon the person's death, or possibly, could pass to the person's heirs only under limited circumstances which could not restrict production of this musical.Groucho Marx Productions v. Day & Night Co., 689 F.2d 317 (2d Cir. 1982). The lawsuit ultimately resulted in favor of the musical's producers. ==References== ==External links== *Internet Broadway Database listing *A Day in Hollywood / A Night in the Ukraine - Plot summary and character descriptions from StageAgent.com *A Day In Hollywood/A Night In The Ukraine Plot and Musical Numbers at guidetomusicaltheatre.com Category:1979 musicals Category:West End musicals Category:Broadway musicals Category:Musicals based on plays Category:Cultural depictions of the Marx Brothers Category:Tony Award-winning musicals Category:Musicals set in Los Angeles Category:Musicals set in Ukraine
