When Helmar (Herbert) discharges Krogstadt (Shannon), the moneylender, from the bank, Krogstadt threatens to expose Nora's act. Believing that her husband will condone what she has done, Nora confesses. Instead, he blames her. This unexpected action changes the doll-wife into a woman of the world, and as such she leaves her husband and three children to go out into the world and apply her knowledge of the serious side of life for her further education. ==Cast== *Elsie Ferguson as Nora Helmar *Holmes Herbert as Thorvald Helmar *Alex Shannon as Krogstadt *Ethel Grey Terry as Mrs. Linden *Warren Cook as Dr. Rank *Zelda Crosby as Ellen, the Maid *Mrs. R.S.
