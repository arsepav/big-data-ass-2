The book Television Series of the 1950s: Essential Facts and Quirky Details described Foster as "a very pretty girl who is called 'the cutest date in town'", adding, "Judy has a knack for finding mischief and has a firm belief that her family doesn't understand her." The Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010 described her as "bright, enthusiastic and 'blessed' with a knack for finding trouble." Judy's parents were Melvyn and Dora Foster, and she had a 12-year-old brother, Randolph. Her boyfriend was Oogie Pringle. The program was derived from the radio show of the same name. ==Cast== The table below shows the actors who portrayed the main characters in the two versions of the program.
