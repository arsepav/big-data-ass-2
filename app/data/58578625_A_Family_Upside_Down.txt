Unable to rely on his wife Emma (Helen Hayes), herself suffering from deteriorating health, Ted grows increasingly dependent on his adult children for his basic needs. Familial bonds are tested when Ted and Emma decide to move in with their son Mike (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) and daughter-in-law Carol (Pat Crowley) rather than face the prospect of living in a retirement home. ==Cast== * Helen Hayes as Emma Long * Fred Astaire as Ted Long * Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Mike Long * Pat Crowley as Carol Long * Patty Duke as Wendy * Brad Rearden as Scott Long * Ford Rainey as Mr. Case * Kim Hamilton as Paula * Phillip R.
