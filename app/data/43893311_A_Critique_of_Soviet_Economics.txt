The Chinese Debate about Soviet Socialism, 1978-1985. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. p. 145. Mao additionally criticized Soviet economists for making the assumption that socialist industrialization was a necessary precondition for the collectivization of agriculture and consequently over-prioritizing the development heavy industry in an unbalanced way.Gilbert Rozman (1987). The Chinese Debate about Soviet Socialism, 1978-1985. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. p. 145–146.
