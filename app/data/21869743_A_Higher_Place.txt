21869743	A Higher Place	A Higher Place is the debut studio album by American progressive metalcore band Born of Osiris. It was released through Sumerian Records on July 7, 2009. A Higher Place debuted at number 73 on the Billboard 200, selling over 6,000 copies. It was the first album to have any creative input outside of the band's mastermind and drummer, Cameron Losch. Up until this point, he had written and recorded everything short of vocals on every song. Though this is mostly true for A Higher Place as well, "Exist" was written and recorded by Lee Mckinney. An earlier instrumental version of this song can be found under the title "Glass Bluntz". Though the two versions are quite different, they share the same hook that "Exist" is mostly noted for. In September 2009, the band announced a new single, "Now Arise", and released the music video for it on the same day. ==Track listing== Notes * Track 1 is a continuation of "The Takeover" from The New Reign EP. ==Personnel== ;Born of Osiris * Ronnie Canizaro – lead vocals * Lee McKinney – lead guitar * David Darocha – bass * Joe Buras – keyboards, backing vocals * Cameron Losch – drums, rhythm guitar, bass ;Production and recording *Chris "Zeuss" Harris – production *Ash Avildsen – executive production *Shawn Keith – executive production *Chris Dowhan – mastering, mixing *Andreas Lars Magnusson – mastering, mixing *Mike Rashmawi – vocal recording ==Charts== Chart (2010) Peak position US Billboard 200 73 US Top Independent Albums 8 ==References== Category:2009 debut albums Category:Sumerian Records albums Category:Born of Osiris albums Category:Albums produced by Chris "Zeuss" Harris
