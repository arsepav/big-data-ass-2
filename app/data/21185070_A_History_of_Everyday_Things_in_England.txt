The series has been in print as late as year 2000,Putnam Pub Group. although they generally went out of print after the 1960s. Marjorie did many of the illustrations. Little or no scholarly research has been done about the Quennells, but as Tony Woolrich writes: :[The books] sold in thousands and were reputed to have been used by more than eight hundred schools in Britain alone and more were in use in overseas in English- speaking schools. Translations of a number of titles have been made into Russian, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Swedish and Danish. The books were illustrated with some coloured drawings of mostly costume, half tones and a profusion of line drawings made by the authors. All the books went into numerous revisions, with the information upgraded to take account of modern knowledge."C. H. B. and Marjorie Quennell". Archived link here. The books were especially strong on housing, agriculture and the way people earned their livings. They were described by Hector Bolitho as “transforming teaching”. In an era when history focused on the Great Man and political forces as the drivers of history, these books about the day to day life of the common person were ahead of their time, which would not come into the fore until the 1970s (see microhistory). In 1935 the Quennell's published The Good New Days (1935), where modern industrial and agricultural processes, together with the problems of the future, were considered. In 1968 author S. E. Ellacott published a fifth volume titled A History of Everyday Things in England: Volume V: 1914-1968.
