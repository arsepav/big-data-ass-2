Islam is also a political ideology that preaches violence and applies its agenda by force." "No one can be a true Muslim and a true American simultaneously. Islam is both a religion and a state, and to be a true Muslim you must believe in Islam as both religion and state. A true Muslim does not acknowledge the U.S. Constitution, and his willingness to live under that constitution is, as far as he is concerned, nothing more than an unavoidable step on the way to the constitution's replacement by Islamic Sharia law." == References == Category:Books critical of Islam Category:2009 non-fiction books Category:St. Martin's Press books
