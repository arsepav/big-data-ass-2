72250785	A Christmas of Love	A Christmas of Love is the ninth studio album by American singer Keith Sweat. It was released by Sweat Shop Records and Rhino Records on November 20, 2007. ==Critical reception== AllMusic found that "Sweat knows something about contemporary R&B;, and his smooth loverman sound, with just a touch of light hip-hop flavor, is all over Christmas of Love [...] With the exception of "The Christmas Song," Sweat steers clear of traditional material, opting instead for narratives of romantic love placed in a holiday context such as "Be Your Santa Claus" and "Under the Tree." Sweat's singing sounds as good as it did in the '80s, and this disc should provide a soundtrack for lovers looking to generate a Yuletide spark." Herald & Review remarked that "tracks such as “Party Christmas” and “Be Your Santa Claus” create the impression that Christmas is just one more occasion for a boudoir workout." ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart performance for A Christmas of Love Chart (2007) Peak position ==Release history== Release history for A Christmas of Love Region Date Format(s) Label United States November 20, 2007 ==References== Category:2007 Christmas albums Category:Keith Sweat albums Category:Rhino Records albums
