It was first published in The Story-Teller in May 1922. It later appeared in The Doves' Nest and Other Stories (1923).Katherine Mansfield, Selected Stories, Oxford World's Classics, explanatory notes Her short stories first appeared in Melbourne in 1907, but literary fame came to her in London after the publication of a collection of short stories called In a German Pension. The character Rosemary Fell is a "fictional reconstruction" of Mansfield's wealthy first cousin, once removed, the writer Elizabeth von Arnim.Maddison, Isobel (2016) Elizabeth von Arnim: Beyond the German Garden, pp. 89â€“90.

Before going to the car, Rosemary is approached by Miss Smith, a poor girl who asks for enough money to buy tea. Instead, Rosemary drives the girl to her plush house, determined to show her "that dreams do come true" and "that rich people did have hearts." At the Fells' home, Miss Smith eats her fill of food and tea. She then begins to tell Rosemary of her life until Rosemary's husband, Philip, comes in. Although initially surprised, Philip recovers and asks to speak to Rosemary alone. In the library, Philip conveys his disapproval. When Rosemary resists dismissing Miss Smith, Philip tries another, more successful, tactic: He plays to Rosemary's jealousy and insecurity by telling her how pretty he thinks Miss Smith is. Rosemary retrieves three pound notes and, presumably, sends the girl away (a far cry from Rosemary's first vow to "look after" and "be frightfully nice to" Miss Smith). Later, Rosemary goes to her husband and informs him that "Miss Smith won't dine with us tonight." She first asks about the antique box from the morning, but then arrives at her true concern, quietly asking Philip, "Am I pretty?" The story ends with this question. ==Major themes== * Class consciousness * Feminism * Materialism * Insecurity * Jealousy ==References to other works== * Rosemary decides to help the poor woman as she feels inspired by stories by Dostoevsky that she has been reading. ==Adaptations== An adaptation of "A Cup of Tea", directed by Shyam Benegal, was included in the Indian television series Katha Sagar in 1986.Awaasthi, Kavita (16 May 2016) A touch of class: Shyam Benegal remembers the stories of Katha Sagar in Hindustan Times.
