The poem describes the lonely death of a shepherd in the bush, alone except for his patient wife. After word of the man's death spreads people start arriving "to see their neighbour and to bury him." ==Reviews== When reviewing Leaves from Australian Forests in The Weekly Times a writer noted that "Mr. Kendall has a few more ambitious efforts, mostly in blank verse; but, although his verse is good, it is too redolent of Tennyson, and we cannot place these pieces on a level with his true and very welcome Australian lyrics. We must except, however, "A death in the bush," which has some true and pathetic touches.""Mr. Kendall's Poems", The Weekly Times, 9 October 1869, p7 Commenting on Henry Kendall's poetry and the crisis of faith in the mid-1880s Michael Ackland stated: "“A Death in the Bush”, like “The Glen of Arawatta”, tries to defend the salving notion of surviving “Love in Death”. Here again, however, the dramatization of grounds for doubt is imaginatively more persuasive than the concluding plea for faith maintained in a far away order. The wasted settler, brought to the verge of death by disease, exclaims feverishly “Where is God? — it is bitter cold”. But no supernatural help is forthcoming for him or his widow, who is left without “The faintest token of Divinity / In this my latest sorrow”."Towards 'The Shadow': Henry Kendall and the Mid-Century Crisis of Faith" by Michael Ackland, Westerly, September vol. 35 no. 3, 1990, p74 ==Further publications == * Selected Poems of Henry Kendall edited by T.
