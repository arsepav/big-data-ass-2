64077058	A Hermit	A Hermit is an oil on oak panel painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Gerrit Dou, created c. 1661. It depicts a monkish figure, of very old age, surrounded by symbols of vanitas (skull, candle, hourglass), which serve as a reminder of the brevity of human life. He looks at the viewer, as he leafs through the Bible open in front of him. The painting is displayed at the Wallace Collection, in London. ==References== ==External links== *Wallace Collection Category:1661 paintings Category:Paintings in the Wallace Collection Category:Paintings by Gerrit Dou Category:Art of the Dutch Golden Age Category:Christian paintings
