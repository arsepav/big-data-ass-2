The song is the opening track on the band's compilation albums, Greatest Hits II, and Classic Queen.Queen Album: Classic Queen MTV. Retrieved 2 July 2011 ==Recording== ===Highlander=== The phrase "a kind of magic" is used in Highlander by Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) as a description of his immortality. Roger Taylor liked the phrase so much that he used it as inspiration for the song. There are references to the film in the lyrics: "one prize, one goal"; "no mortal man"; and "there can be only one". The single's cover art features an image of Clancy Brown in character as the film's villain, The Kurgan. ===Composition=== Taylor wrote the song, which originally appeared in the movie Highlander. Brian May described this original version as "quite lugubrious and heavy". For the album version, Freddie Mercury created a new bass line, added instrumental breaks, and changed the song's order to make it more chart friendly. Mercury and David Richards produced this new version. In a radio interview in September 2017, Chris Rea claimed that he performed the finger clicks with which the song opens. ==Live performances== The song was a live favourite on The Magic Tour of the same year, which proved to be Queen's last tour before the death of Freddie Mercury. Taylor often included the song in solo set lists, and those with his band The Cross. On the Rock the Cosmos Tour of Europe, Taylor took lead vocals for the song at some concerts. ==Music video== The music video for this song was directed by Russell Mulcahy, director of Highlander. Notable is that Brian May did not use his famous Red Special guitar in the music video, but instead a 1984 copy. In the video, Mercury is dressed as a magician type figure. He enters an abandoned theatre (The Playhouse Theatre in London) where May, Taylor and John Deacon (all dressed as stereotypical tramps) are asleep until awakened by Mercury's entrance. Mercury transforms the hobos into the Queen members, dressed regularly with their instruments, then back to hobos again as he leaves. Throughout the video, cartoon images dance to the beat of the song which were produced by The Walt Disney Company.As May later remembered, the theater was old and derelict, and lacking central heating, so the band were quite cold during the March filming. ==Legacy== The single was certified platinum in Brazil for more than 100,000 digital downloads of the single.ABPD | Associaçăo Brasileira de Produtores de Disco Queen's compilations The Platinum Collection, Classic Queen, and Greatest Hits II all make an unsubstantiated claim that the song reached #1 in 35 countries around the world, but it reached number one in Spain in 1986, the only country where it topped the charts. Musical theatre actress Elaine Paige recorded the song on her album of Queen covers The Queen Album in 1988. ==Chart positions== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1986) Position Argentina (CAPIF) 1 Australian Singles Chart 6 Austrian Singles Chart 12 Canadian Singles Chart 64 Dutch Singles Chart 4 Finland (Suomen Virallinen) 16 French Singles Chart 5 German Singles Chart 6 Irish Singles Chart 3 New Zealand Singles Chart 23 Spain (Los 40 Principales) 1 Swiss Singles Chart 3 UK Singles Chart 3 U.S. Singles Chart 42 Chart (2013) Peak position Slovenia (SloTop50) 32 Chart (2022) Peak position ==Sales and certifications== ==Personnel== ;Queen *Freddie Mercury – lead and backing vocals *Brian May – electric guitars, backing vocals *Roger Taylor – drums, drum machine, backing vocals *John Deacon – bass guitar with *Chris Rea – uncredited fingerclicks *Spike Edney - keyboards ==Usage in other media== * The music was used in the trailer for the film The Adventures of Pinocchio. * A promotional music video, made by Boeing, was released called, Hornet Magic was released on VHS.
