A Feast for Odin is a Euro-style game created by Uwe Rosenberg. It is a worker placement game focused on placement of irregular cardboard polyominoes into boards owned by each player. The polyominoes are between 2 and 12 square units large, with art depicting various Viking-themed items such as beans, milk, flax, and linen. The full game is 7 rounds long, with an option for a shorter 6-round game. The rounds increase in length; the number of workers each player may use goes up by 1 each round. A Feast for Odin was published in 2016 by Z-Man Games. It can be played by between 1 and 4 players. == Gameplay == thumb|The 12 phases in each round of A Feast for Odin Players start the game with their main board in front of them.
