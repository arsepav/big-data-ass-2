United States: Biograph, 1909. Video. https://www.loc.gov/item/2012600307/ is a 1909 American short silent film which tells of a greedy tycoon who tries to corner the world market on wheat, destroying the lives of the people who can no longer afford to buy bread. It was directed by D. W. Griffith and adapted by Griffith and Frank E. Woods from a novel and a short story by Frank Norris, titled The Pit and A Deal in Wheat. Intercutting (cross-cutting) between still tableaux of the poor in the bread line and the lavish, active parties of the wealthy speculator somewhat anticipates the collision montage which became a hallmark of the politically charged Soviet cinema a decade or so later. In 1994, A Corner in Wheat was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". The film was also released on 8mm in the 1960s. ==Cast== thumb|right|upright=1.0|thumbtime=6:54| * Frank Powell as The wheat king * James Kirkwood as The poor farmer * Linda Arvidson as The poor farmer's wife * Gladys Egan as The poor farmer's daughter * Henry B.

Because of an upsurge in political populism, audience reacted to the film positively. Before A Corner in Wheat, Griffith avoided making political statements in his film. After the film's success, he began to make bolder statements about society and politics, such as famously championing white supremacy in The Birth of a Nation (1915). ==See also== * D. W.
