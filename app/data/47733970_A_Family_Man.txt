The film tells the story of Dane Jensen, a Corporate Recruiter from Chicago, who must balance his career aspirations and his increasingly complex family life. The film stars Gerard Butler, Willem Dafoe, Anupam Kher, Alfred Molina, Alison Brie, and Gretchen Mol. Principal photography began on October 26, 2015 in Toronto. It screened at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. == Plot == Dane Jensen is a successful Chicago-based corporate headhunter who works at the Blackridge Recruitment agency. His life revolves around closing deals in a survival-of-the-fittest boiler room. As the film opens Jensen is shown to be focused on his job, but he also tries to be a family man. His boss Ed Blackridge is offering him a promotion that will lead to him controlling the company. To secure it, he must beat his ambitious rival Lynn Wilson's numbers. Jensen's focus on the job becomes a detriment to his family. His wife Elise asks for more of his time with them. Jensen tries to spend some quality time with his oldest child Ryan, to prepare him for the adult world. Believing Ryan to be on the verge of childhood obesity, he takes him jogging in the morning. Jensen notices that his son is constantly complaining of fatigue and has bruises he can't explain. Jensen works harder and spends more time at the office to try to get the promotion, which does not sit right with Elise. She asks him to prioritize. Ryan is later diagnosed with cancer, which shocks them all. Jensen spends more time with his son, which causes his numbers — a prerequisite of the promotion — to drop. Meanwhile, Lynn takes the opportunity to tap into his clients and scores. The film culminates with Ryan falling into a coma before getting better, and Jensen losing his job at Ed's firm, due to not turning a profit. The seemingly strict Ed releases him from his non-compete agreement. Jensen starts his own company working from home and is now invested with his family. == Cast == * Gerard Butler as Dane Jensen, Elise's husband and Lauren and Ryan's father * Gretchen Mol as Elise Jensen, Dane's wife and Lauren and Ryan's mother * Alison Brie as Lynn Wilson, Dane's rival * Anupam Kher as Dr. Savraj Singh * Willem Dafoe as Ed Blackridge, Dane's boss * Alfred Molina as Lou Wheeler * Dustin Milligan as Sumner Firestone * Maxwell Jenkins as Ryan Jensen, Dane and Elise's son and Lauren's brother * Julia Butters as Lauren Jensen, Dane and Elise's daughter and Ryan's sister * Mimi Kuzyk as Bernadine * Dwayne Murphy as Antoine, Ryan's nurse * Kathleen Munroe as Toni == Production == In November 2012, Bill Dubuque's first script The Headhunter's Calling was revealed.
