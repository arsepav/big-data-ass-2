The Works by M.Gorky in 30 volumes. Vol.8. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura // На базе Собрания сочинений в 30-ти томах. ГИХЛ, 1949-1956. The tale of Matvey, a pilgrim, was based upon the real-life story of a religious sectarian in Nizhny Novgorod, and an article on him by Bogdan-Stepanets, a tutor at the local seminary. Later, in a sketch called "On the Edge of the World", Gorky mentioned another source, the manuscript by a Levonty Pomorets, which the writer's friend S.G. Somov brought with him from his Siberian exile. The novel, written in the times when Gorky became keenly interested in the new quasi-religious God-Building movement, horrified Vladimir Lenin who on several occasions criticized the attempts to unite Socialism and Christianity, mentioning A Confession.В.И.Ленин. Сочинения, изд. 3-е, т.XVII, стр.81—82 Gorky explained: "I am an atheist. In A Confession the idea was to show the means by which man could progress from individualism to the collectivist understanding of the world. The main character sees 'God- building' as an attempt to reconstruct social life according to the spirit of collectivism, the spirit of uniting the people on their way to one common goal: liberating man from slavery, within and without."Я - атеист. В «Исповеди» мне нужно было показать, какими путями человек может придти от индивидуализма к коллективистическому пониманию мира... Герой «Исповеди» понимает под «богостроительством» устроение народного бытия в духе коллективистическом, в духе единения всех по пути к единой цели - освобождению человека от рабства внутреннего и внешнего. ==References== ==External links== Category:1908 Russian novels Category:Novels by Maxim Gorky Category:Novels set in 20th-century Russia
