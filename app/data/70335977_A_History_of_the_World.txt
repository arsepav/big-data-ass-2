Illustrated with hundreds of black-and-white and color images, printed on polished paper by Richard Geiger, and was published by Műintézet és Kiadóvállalat R.-T. in Budapest. The six volumes range from the Ancient East to the present (i.e. the beginning of the 20th century). They cover the period of ancient Greeks, the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages and the modern age. In each volume, the editor used works by Victor Duruy, Fekten Károly, H. Grimme, Heyck Ödön, Huber Alfonz, and Alfred Nicolas Rambaud. The series is divided into six volumes, but some parts extend into other volumes, and some parts start in the middle of a volume. This makes it difficult to use the work.
