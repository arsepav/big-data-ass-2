55446186	A Criação	A Criação (English: The Creation) is a Portuguese television series produced by Até ao Fim do Mundo. It premiered on 19 September 2017. It was the first television series to have all episodes released at the same time on RTP Play, a Netflix-style streaming service owned by Rádio e Televisão de Portugal. == Plot == Each episode unfolds around a project, such as a movie, event, or public relations activity that the client is assigned by an advertising agency. Each episode depicts the production of the idea, including pseudo- rational choices and decisions that reduce it to a travesty. The absurdity is heightened by the fact that the employees are portrayed by actors in animal costumes. Throughout the series, stories develop relationships between various characters: a romantic relationship between Bear and Chicken, Lion's ambition to climb the ranks, a secret romance between Giraffe and Rat, a classic relationship between Sheep and Shepherd, and Dog's attachment to guarding Sheep. In addition, the series shows the envy among creative professionals, who turn out to be "typical of an office full of stuffed animals." == Cast == * Alba Baptista as Little Mouse * Bárbara Lourenço as Woodcock * Bruna Quintas as Little Robot * Diogo Mesquita as Bear * Gonçalo Carvalho as Little Lion * Mafalda Jara as Giraffe * Rita Tristão da Silva as Little Lamb * Romeu Vala as Raven * Tomás Alves as Dog * Angel Tovar as Fox * Luís Lobão as Shepherd == Episodes == == References == Category:Portuguese-language television shows Category:2017 Portuguese television series debuts
