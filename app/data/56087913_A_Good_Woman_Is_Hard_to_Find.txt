Her son Ben has been an elective mute since the day he witnessed his father being knifed to death on their estate in the middle of the day. Police have done nothing to catch the killer, categorising his death as a falling-out amongst thieves. One day, after ripping off local crime boss Leo Miller, Tito breaks into Sarah's flat, where he decides to stash the stolen drugs.

Leo discovers that Tito was the one who stole his drugs and his connection to Sarah. Leo confronts Sarah and the children while they are out shopping. Ben runs away after seeing Leo and when Sarah catches up to him, he confirms that Leo was the one who killed his father. She later agrees to bring Tito to Leo.
