After reviewing expenses, he decides that the best way to save money is to cancel the music program in which his niece Fern (Alison Pill) is enrolled and let go its teacher, Lily Waite (Naomi Judd). News of his decision leaks out prematurely, causing resentment among the students. After realizing how much the program has benefited his shy niece, he regrets his decision, but can think of no better alternative. In a subplot, with Peterson's help, a long- time lady friend secretly arranges a reunion of his father Jake Peterson's WWII squadron, as a Christmas present. He is so happy that he decides to propose. The film ends with a concert by the music department's students, where Peterson hears his niece perform and then announces that the townspeople have donated enough money to keep the program going. ==Cast== *Naomi Judd as Lily Waite *Andy Griffith as Jake Peterson *Gerald McRaney as Cal Peterson *Alison Pill as Fern *Jayne Eastwood as Margie *Taborah Johnson as Anne Hutchinson *Jackie Richardson as Bea Buskins *Brian Heighton as Todd *Jack Duffy as Irwin *Sumela Kay as Clarissa *Adam Dolson as Del *Nathan Carter as Hal *Martha Gibson as Donna *Andrea Lewis as Autumn *Aron Tager as Joseph *Ken Wickes as Pete *The Essentials with Paula MacNeill as singers at gas station ==Production== A Holiday Romance was filmed in Toronto by Jaffe/Braunstein Productions and directed by Bobby Roth.
