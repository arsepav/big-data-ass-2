It was filmed in Taiwan, Hong Kong and partly on location in Tibet. ==Plot== When the evil "Black Section of Esoteric Buddhism" had tried to invade Tibet years ago, the Tibetan monks used a powerful magical item, the "Babu Gold Bottle" to expel them. The Tibetan master (Wu Ma) has the bottle's cap and wishes to reunite it with the bottle as the Black Section are stirring once more. He sends a young monk, Wong La (Yuen Biao) to Hong Kong to recover the sacred bottle, which is in the possession of a crippled lawyer. Wong meets and protects a woman, Chiu Seng-Neng (Michelle Reis) who is acting as the agent for the lawyer, and the Black Section fight to gain the magical bottle for themselves. The leader of the Black Section (Yuen Wah) learns of the intended hand-over, and seeks to get the Babu Gold Bottle for himself. ==Cast== * Yuen Biao as Lo Ba Wong La * Michelle Reis as Chiu Seng-neng * Yuen Wah as Black Section Sorcerer * Nina Li Chi as Sorcerer's Sister * Roy Chiao as Lawyer Robinson * Michael Dingo as Michael * Wu Ma as Wong's Master * Billy Lau as Airport Security Guard / Jail Warden * Lau Chau-sang (Fung Lee) as Tibetan henchman * Lay Kah as Tibetan henchman * Jackie Chan as Airport Passenger * Kingdom Yuen as Mimi * Gabriel Wong as Mimi's lover * Anthony Carpio as Black Section Sorcerer's Henchman * Jack Wong * Corey Yuen * Lee Ming-yeung as Mr. Bao * Bruce Law ==See also== * List of Hong Kong films *Jackie Chan filmography ==External links== * * Category:1992 films Category:1992 action films Category:1992 martial arts films Category:Hong Kong action films Category:Hong Kong martial arts films Category:1990s Cantonese- language films Category:Films set in Hong Kong Category:Films shot in Hong Kong Category:1992 directorial debut films Category:1990s Hong Kong films
