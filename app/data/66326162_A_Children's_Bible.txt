It was her 13th novel. ==Plot== ===Context=== Eve, the novel's narrator, belongs to a group of children staying at a large, rented estate with their parents for the summer. The children, mostly disgusted by their parents' hedonistic behavior, spend most of their time on the property of the estate, until a hurricane interrupts their activities. The parents are never named, and the book filters their activities through the perception of Eve and the other children. ==Development and writing== Millet has said that the novel does not take place in an "alternate world, simply this one" and believes that words such as apocalyptic or dystopian used to describe the book apply equally to contemporary life. Millet enjoyed writing the book. ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== According to literary review aggregator Book Marks, the novel received mostly favorable reviews. The New York Times book review called the book a "potent allegory". The Wall Street Journal review of the novel focuses on how the novel has humor in the face of a grim plot.
