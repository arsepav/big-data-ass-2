Curious, he asks Ed about it, and is given the history and tactics of men who have successfully committed adultery. With each new story, Paul cannot help noticing the attractive blonde, Irma Johnson, who lives nearby. Paul gets close to cheating on his wife, Ruth, but he never quite goes through with it. In a scene near the end of the movie, he is finally in a motel room with another woman, a wealthy divorced client. Paul hears shouting outside, and when he looks out the window, he sees photographers taking pictures of his friend Ed in bed with Mrs. Johnson. Paul takes this opportunity to flee the scene and run home to his beloved wife. ==Cast== * Walter Matthau as Paul Manning * Inger Stevens as Ruth Manning * Sue Ane Langdon as Irma Johnson * Robert Morse as Ed Stander * Elaine Devry as Jocelyn * Jackie Joseph as Janet Brophy * Aline Towne as Mousey Man's Wife * Claire Kelly as Harriet Stander * Eve Brent as Joe X's Blowsy Blonde * Marvin Brody as Taxi Driver * Jackie Russell as Miss Harris, Manning's Secretary * Majel Barrett as Mrs. Fred V. * Linda Harrison as Miss Stardust * Chanin Hale as Miss Crenshaw ===Cameo appearances=== * Lucille Ball as Mrs. Joe X * Jack Benny as Ollie 'Sweet Lips' * Polly Bergen as Clara Brown * Joey Bishop as Charlie * Ben Blue as Shoeless * Sid Caesar as Man at Romanoff's * Art Carney as Joe X * Wally Cox as Man Married 14 Years * Ann Morgan Guilbert as Charlie's Wife * Jeffrey Hunter as Mountain Climber * Marty Ingels as Meat Eater * Sam Jaffe as Shrink * Jayne Mansfield as Girl with Harold * Hal March as Man Who Loses Coat * Louis Nye as Irving, House Buyer * Carl Reiner as Rance G. * Michael Romanoff as Romanoff's Maitre'd * Jason Wingreen as Harry 'Big Fella' Johnson * Phil Silvers as Realtor * Terry-Thomas as Harold 'Tiger' * Delores Wells as Girl with Wally Cox * Heather Young as Girl with Megaphone ==Reception== ===Critical response=== A Guide for the Married Man is simply "a series of dumb skits" in Pauline Kael's estimation, and the famous names in the cast are all wasted: "what they do is no more memorable than the plugs for brand-name products that are scattered throughout". Film critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times greatly enjoyed the movie, calling it "The broadest and funniest farce to come out of Hollywood since the Russians came last year...who would imagine that a film pretending to be a how-to on infidelity would be funny or even in good taste?" and adding "what is thoroughly and delightfully disarming about this mischievous film is the impudent candor of it and its freedom from the leer." The staff at Variety wrote in their review: "Walter Matthau plays a married innocent, eager to stray under the tutelage of friend and neighbor Robert Morse. But this long- married hubby is so retarded in his Immorality (it takes him 12 years to get the seven-year-itch) that, between his natural reluctance and mentor Morse's suggestions (interlarded with warnings against hastiness), he needs the entire film to have his mind made up." Film critic Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times wrote in his review: "There are a lot of funny people in this movie, but they are not very funny people in this movie, Gertrude Stein might have said. The Casino Royale syndrome has struck again in A Guide for the Married Man, and we are forced to sit and watch as dozens of big-name stars jostle each other for their moment before the cameras." ===Release=== According to Fox records, A Guide for the Married Man needed to earn $5,900,000 in rentals to break even, and made $7,355,000, meaning it made a profit. ===Home media=== The film was released on DVD on September 6, 2005, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. ==See also== * List of American films of 1967 * Jack Benny filmography ==References== ===Further reading=== * * * * * ==External links== * * * * * Category:1967 films Category:1960s sex comedy films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:Adultery in films Category:American sex comedy films Category:1960s English-language films Category:Films scored by John Williams Category:Films directed by Gene Kelly Category:1967 comedy films Category:1960s American films
