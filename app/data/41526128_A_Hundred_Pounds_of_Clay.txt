The controversy arose not from the fact that it was a religious song, but because the censors interpreted the song as suggesting women were created simply to be sexual beings, and the BBC felt something that was considered blasphemous. ==References== Category:1961 songs Category:1961 singles Category:Songs written by Luther Dixon Category:Gene McDaniels songs Category:The Impressions songs Category:Dickie Goodman songs Category:Song recordings produced by Snuff Garrett Category:Liberty Records singles Category:Songs written by Bob Elgin
