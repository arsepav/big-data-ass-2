A Garibaldian in the Convent (Italian: Un garibaldino al convento) is a 1942 Italian historical comedy drama romantic film directed by Vittorio De Sica and starring Leonardo Cortese, María Mercader and Carla Del Poggio. It is considered to be the work with which De Sica concludes the series of light comedies largely set in colleges and institutions for young girls and period costumes to enter into films of more contemporary and popular settings that will result in post-war neorealistic works. It was screened in November 1991 as a part of a retrospective of De Sica's films at the Museum of Modern Art. It was shot at the Palatino Studios in Rome. The film's sets were designed by the art director Veniero Colasanti. ==Plot== In the early years of the 20th century, a grandmother tells the story of a picture to her grandchildren of how many years before, in 1860, she and her rival María Mercader as Mariella Dominiani, were both students of the convent of Santa Rossana.
