Music is less effective without visuals. I am going to > change this situation.» In 2008, in an interview for the portal RapReviews, Sticky Fingaz referred to the new film as a movie built on rap: «A Day In The Life — basically it's Black Trash, the Kirk Jones album, on steroids. The whole entire movie is a wrap. There are no regular parts in the movie at all, all the dialogue is in rap.» == Release == The film premiered on July 2, 2009 in West Hollywood, California.

Erin Burris from JustPressPlay wrote her review: «...The movie was just an endless array of flashy camera and flashier guns and jewelry. It was shot after shot of shot after shot. The whole film was a glorified music video and an excuse to show ladies in hot tubs and gratuitous gun shot wounds. No wonder it didn’t have a theatrical release.» Bart Rietvink from Cine Magazine also spoke on this subject: «...Women like sex objects, gangsters, shoot outs, and pampered rides abound in 'A Day in the Life', but it all thunders little when the lyrics reach the viewer (usually) in rhyme and accompanied with a nice beat.» Tyler Foster from DVDTalk gave his own assessment: «...And yet A Day in the Life is a highly entertaining and extremely watchable movie, because the plot and direction all take a backseat to Jones' central conceit, which is clever, interesting and different.» Christopher Armstead from FilmCriticsUnited summed up: «...I did enjoy watching ‘A Day in the Life’ which is the second Hip Hopera I’ve seen with the first being ‘Confessions of a Thug’. ‘Thug’ was probably an overall better movie than ‘Life’ even though it had a quarter of a percent of the star power of ‘Life’, but... ‘A Day in the Life’ was 100% pure hip-hop.» Jeff from The Jaded Viewer gave his final forecast: «See this movie. At least, for novelty sake. I mean this film has singlehandedly reaffirmed my faith in modern black cinema. I had once been lost and confused. Searching for something to fill the emptiness in my soul that was once filled with rap and gang violence. But now, I can say, once again, I am whole. Yes, I have found my savior. And my savior’s name is Sticky Fingaz.» == See also == * List of hood films ==References== ==External links== * * Various – A Day In The Life: The Soundtrack at Discogs Category:2009 films Category:2000s crime films Category:2000s musical films Category:2000s hip hop films Category:Hood films Category:Lionsgate films Category:Rap operas Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s American films
