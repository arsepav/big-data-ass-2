A Date with a Dream is a 1948 British musical comedy film directed by Dicky Leeman and starring Terry-Thomas, Jeannie Carson and Wally Patch. Its plot concerns a wartime group of musical entertainers who meet up a year after being demobbed and decide to reform their act. This was one of Terry-Thomas's earliest films and is reputedly partly based on his own experiences. Terry- Thomas was yet to develop his cad persona and a then little-known Norman Wisdom appears in a very brief, non-speaking role. ==Plot== When an Army concert party is disbanded after the war, they plan to meet up in a years time for a reunion. When they do they discover that all the various members aren't coping too well with civilian life. Jean, a singer who is staying in the same house as two of the ex-concert party members, suggests that the various members get back together to perform. ==Cast== * Terry-Thomas – Terry * Jeannie Carson – Jean * Len Lowe – Len * Bill Lowe – Bill * Wally Patch – Uncle * Vic Lewis – Vic * Ida Patlanski – Bedelia * Joey Porter – Max Imshy * Alfie Dean – Joe * Julia Lang – Madam Docherty * Harry Green – Syd Marlish * Norman Wisdom – Shadow Boxer * Sydney Bromley – Stranger in Max's office ==Critical reception== Sky Movies wrote, "a sparkling performance from the young Terry-Thomas and a bright, sassy attitude saves this dated, rather choppy little filler item from the scrapheap of movie history. Worth a look for nostalgia buffs and curio collectors". A Date With A Dream was the first production of Tempean Films, a production company founded by Monty Berman and Robert S. Baker following their war service. Of the film, Baker later commented, "It didn't make us a penny, but it gave us a good introduction to the film business". Tempean would go on to produce many British B-movies throughout the 1950s and into the early 1960s ==References== ==External links== * * dvd of the film * interview British Entertainment History Project Category:1948 films Category:British musical comedy films Category:1948 musical comedy films Category:British black-and-white films Category:1940s English-language films Category:1940s British films
