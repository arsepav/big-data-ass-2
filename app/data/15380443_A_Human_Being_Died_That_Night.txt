A Human Being Died That Night is a 2003 book by Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela. The book is Gobodo-Madikizela's account of her interviews with state-sanctioned mass murderer Eugene De Kock from the time of apartheid in South Africa. These interviews are mixed in with stories of victims and criminals on both sides of the racial barrier with whom she met during her time as a member of the Human Rights Violations Committee, a part of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The book focuses on her growing empathy for those pushed by a cruel system into losing their morality and becoming killers (killers from all races) and her attempt to understand what causes someone to be able to commit crimes against humanity, and is considered an examination of the broader impact of the Truth Commission process. The book is 197 pages, separated into chapters.Gobodo-Madikizela, Pumla. A Human Being Died That Night: A South African Story of Forgiveness. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2003.

He became involved in the South African police force, and in 1983 he earned the title of Commander in the Vlakplaas Unit. He took part in the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa) where he confessed to the murders of hundreds of people. He was then sentenced to 212 years plus two life sentences in 1996; he stayed in prison until 2016 when he was released on parole. De Kock was given the nickname Prime Evil. This nickname was given to him by South African citizens, most of whom were victims and/or families of victims of his crimes. In the book, Gobodo-Madikizela mentions this nickname making her nervous going into the interviews, as she was afraid he would be truly evil as people depicted him to be.Gobodo-Madikizela, Pumla.

The premise was to have the full truth about politically charged crimes committed during apartheid be told, but to then grant most of the criminal amnesty if they did tell the truth. Those leading the TRC were, Desmond Tutu, chairman, and Alex Boraine, deputy chairman. The TRC had 22,000 statements from victims, 7,000 amnesty applications, 2,500 amnesty hearings, and 1,500 amnesties were granted.Tutu, Desmond.
