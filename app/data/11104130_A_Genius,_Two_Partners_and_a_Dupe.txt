The movie was also released in English under four different titles: * A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe * A Genius, Two Friends and an Idiot * Trinity is Back Again * Nobody's the Greatest These different titles feature lightly different scenarios, or longer scenes. This was due to the fact that some of the best footage was stolen, and the director refusing to pay the ransom. They had to re-shoot some scenes but lacked the time for some of them. Consequently, it became impossible to edit the movie with perfect coherence. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1975 films Category:1970s Western (genre) comedy films Category:Films about con artists Category:Films directed by Damiano Damiani Category:Films directed by Sergio Leone Category:Spaghetti Western films Category:Films scored by Ennio Morricone Category:Films shot in Utah Category:Films shot in Almería Category:Films with screenplays by Ernesto Gastaldi Category:English-language French films Category:English-language German films Category:English-language Italian films Category:Italian Western (genre) comedy films Category:1975 comedy films Category:1970s Italian films Category:Foreign films set in the United States
