A > view in a courtyard, at the end of which an open door with two steps leads > into the garden at the back, the trees in which rise above the low wall. In > the left foreground a man who is smoking a pipe sits in profile to the > right; he wears a black coat, a grey cloak, and a black hat. To the right, > opposite him at the table, stands a woman drinking a glass of beer; she > wears a yellowish-grey jacket, a red skirt, and a blue apron. Behind the > table and between the man and woman sits another man, wearing a cuirass and > a hat, who faces the spectator; he holds a mug in his hand and looks up with > a smile at the woman. From the right a little girl holding a pot comes > across the courtyard. In the left background is seen the tower of the Nieuwe > Kerk at Delft.
