Arthur Fanshawe (John Lithgow), a new diplomat eager to leave Africa, learns that Kinjanja sits on top of a huge oil reserve. Unfortunately, Morgan is too preoccupied with alcohol and women to know what to do with the oil. To make matters worse, a woman is struck by lightning on the British compound, creating a tense political situation with the Kinjanja government. ==Cast== * Colin Friels as Morgan Leafy * Sean Connery as Dr. Alex Murray * John Lithgow as Arthur Fanshawe * Diana Rigg as Chloe Fanshawe * Louis Gossett Jr. as Prof. Sam Adekunle * Joanne Whalley as Celia Adekunle * Sarah-Jane Fenton as Priscilla Fanshawe * Maynard Eziashi as Friday, Leafy's Houseman ==Reception== The movie received mixed to poor reviews. Roger Ebert said that he felt uncomfortable during the film but praised the performances of Connery, Lithgow and Gossett. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post said that although the film "held the possibility of being a welcome departure from the ordinary [...] ordinary is what it rises to at its best." Janet Maslin of The New York Times opined that "a good book is the basis for "A Good Man in Africa," but its mordant humor has curdled badly on the screen," adding: The film's director, Bruce Beresford, did not remember the film fondly: > God, that was horrible. That was the worst film experience I ever had. It > was cast wrong, the crew was all strange. We were filming in the wrong > place. We filmed in South Africa, it was set in West Africa. Which is like > shooting in Alaska when it’s set in New Orleans. And I realized that > although the novel that it’s based on is terribly funny, it was very > anecdotal. It had no narrative. I think on about the second day I realized > it was never going to work, because the scenes don’t link. I thought, “I’m > sunk! I’m never gonna get out.”"Driving Miss Daisy Director Bruce Beresford > on Aussie Cinema, Powerless Characters, and His Worst Film Experience" 23 > Sept 2015 ==DVD release== Focus Features released an Amazon.com exclusive DVD of the film on 11 January 2010. == References == ==External links== * * * Category:1994 comedy films Category:1994 films Category:Adultery in films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films directed by Bruce Beresford Category:Films scored by John Du Prez Category:Films set in Africa Category:Gramercy Pictures films Category:American political satire films Category:Films with screenplays by William Boyd (writer) Category:1990s English-language films Category:1990s American films
