ABC describes the film as an "intimate and crude history about the Venezuelan peasants of 1948". == Synopsis == Based on the novel Vincentino Guerrero by Freddy Sosa, it tells the story of a farming family in 1948 Los Andes headed by Tomás Alonso that is broken when his wife dies, leaving him to take care of his son alone. To console him, Tomás gives his son a photograph of his mother by the sea, with the boy developing a fascination for the sea. Tomás struggles with wanting his son to love the farmland and protecting the boy from their richer neighbors. == Cast == * Imanol Arias * Gabriel Arcand * Leandro Arvelo * Alejo Felipe * Héctor Manrique * Manuela Aguirre * Marcel Jaworski * Nerio Zerpa * Bernardino Angel * Ramona Pérez == Awards == Year Event Category Result Ref 2001 Havana Film Festival Glauber Rocha Award FIPRESCI Award Festival de Cine Iberoamericano de Huelva Audience Award 2002 Biarritz Film Festival Audience Award Fribourg International Film Festival Audience Award Cartagena Film Festival OCIC Award Cinemanila International Film Festival Special Jury Prize Miami International Film Festival Golden Egret Award Oslo Film Festival Best Latin Film 2003 LaCinemaFe Silver Apple Award for Best Film ==See also== *List of submissions to the 74th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film ==References== ==External links== * *A House with a View of the Sea at Cine Mestizo Category:2001 films Category:Venezuelan drama films Category:2000s Spanish-language films Category:2001 drama films
