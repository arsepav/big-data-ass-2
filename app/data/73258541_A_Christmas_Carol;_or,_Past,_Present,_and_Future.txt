Later, in his memoirs, Stirling wrote that Dickens came to several rehearsals during which he made 'valuable suggestions'. Dickens stated in his letters that he went to the Adelphi to see the production but had mixed feelings about it. Stirling revived his production in 1859.Playbill for 'A Christmas Carol', Theatre Royal Adelphi, 1844, Collection of the Charles Dickens Museum Two woodcuts of scenes from the production, drawing heavily on the original illustrations by John Leech, were published in The Illustrated London News on 17 February 1844.Scene from The Christmas Carol at the Adelphi Theatre, The Illustrated London News, Saturday, 17 February 1844, p. 109Scene from "The Christmas Carol," at the Adelphi Theatre, Victorian Web online database The critic of The Illustrated London News wrote of the production: > We have already given a slight sketch of this happy dramatic adaptation from > Dickens's admirable "romance of real life;" we will now proceed to > illustrate it, more through the graphical agency of our artist than by > anything we could ourselves indite.

Uncaring and unfeeling, Scrooge lives a cold and solitary life mocking those who celebrate Christmas, including his nephew, Fred. On the evening of Christmas Eve Scrooge gets a visit from his long-dead partner, Jacob Marley, who warns him he is on the path to destruction. But visits from three Christmas Spirits may save him from that hellish fate. ==Scenes== ===Stave the First — The First of the Three Spirits=== *Chamber of Scrooge the Miser *A Child's Story Book *Home for the Holidays *Fezziwig's Ball ===Stave the Second — The Second of the Three Spirits=== *Scrooge's Chamber - The Dream *Clare Market by Gaslight *Christmas Eve *Bob Cratchit's, Camden Town *Christmas Dinner *The Lighthouse and Open Sea. ===Stave the Third — The Last of the Spirits=== *The Desolate Churchyard *The Miser's Grave *Scrooge's Home - the Carol *General Invitation to Everybody, and Tiny Tim's Blessing on us All ==Cast (1844)== ===Stave the First — The First of the Three Spirits=== * Ebenezer Scrooge, (the Money Lender—a Christmas Hater- a name only GOOD upon ‘Change) - Mr. 0.
