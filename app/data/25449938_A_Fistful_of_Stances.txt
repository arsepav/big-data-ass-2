A Fistful of Stances () is a 2010 TVB television drama from Hong Kong produced and created by Lee Tim-shing. The Chinese title, literally meaning "Iron Horse Seeks Bridge," defines a person who is able to finally use his high potential to learn powerful techniques. ==Synopsis== Au-Yeung Wai-Lan (Yuen Qiu), owner of a martial arts training school, is reunited with her long-lost son Ku Yu Cheung (Kevin Cheng) after years of agonizing separation. On his return home, Yu-Cheung is shocked to find that his younger brother Koo Yu-Tong (Kenneth Ma) has been critically ill and that his father was murdered long ago by Wing Tak (Dominic Lam), the existing director of a pharmaceutical company and a bitter old foe of the Koos. Pinning all the family hope on Yu-Cheung, he later learns a special set of kung fu skills, and register for the Seven States Martial Arts Championship Tournament. Out of the blue, Yu-Cheung's opponent in the final turns out to be Wing Man-Kwan (Jacky Heung). After the tournament, Yu- Cheung and his family found evidence to prove to everyone that Wing Tak is guilty. Wing Tak began to use cruel ways again to save himself. ==Cast== Ku family Cast Role Description Chung King-fai Au-Yeung Biu 歐陽彪 Au-Yeung Wai-lan's father Ku Kin-shing's father-in-law Killed by Wing-Tak Eileen Yeow Hau Ho-Fa 侯荷花 Au-Yeung Wai-lan's stepmother Au-Yeung Biu's 2nd Wife Killed by Wing-Tak (Semi-Villain) Tavia Yeung Au-Yeung Wai-Lan 歐陽惠蘭 Mother of Ku Yue-chang, Ku Yue-tong, Ku Yue-yan, Ku Man-kuen, Ku Yue- leung Yuen Qiu Kevin Cheng Ku Kin-Shing 顧堅誠 Au-Yeung Wai-Lan's husband Father of Ku Yue-Cheung, Ku Yue-Tong, Ku Yue-yan, Ku Man-kuen, Ku Yue-Leung and Ying Ngan-Ming Killed by Wing-Tak, witnessed by Au-Yeung Biu's apprentice, Pai Jeung (排 長) Ku Yu Cheung 顧汝章 Previous identity was Law Siu Dong (羅小冬) Au-Yeung Wai-Lan and Ku Kin-shing's long lost son and first child Love triangle with Ying Ngan-Ming and Chow Bing-Bing Wing Tak's sworn enemy Chow Bing Bing' ex-boyfriend Ying Ngan-Ming's love interest Kenneth Ma Ku Yu-Tong 顧汝棠 Au-Yeung Wai Lan's Second Child Had Asthma from the age of 19 Wing Tak's sworn enemy Stephen Wong Ka-Lok Ku Yu-Yan 顧汝仁 Love triangle with Ku Yue-leung and Wing Tsz-Yau Au-Yeung Wai Lan's Third Child Shirley Yeung Ku Man-Kuen 顧文娟 Au-Yeung Wai Lan's Fourth Child elder twin sister of Ku Yue-leung Ho Ho-yin's ex-girlfriend Alex Lam (林子善) Ku Yu-Leung 顧汝良 Love triangle with Ku Yue-yan and Wing Tsz-Yau Au-Yeung Wai Lan's Fifth Child Twins younger brother of Ku Man-kuen Natalie Tong Ying Ngan-Ming 應雁鳴 Love triangle with Chow Bing-bing and Ku Yu-cheung Au-Yeung Wai Lan's Adopted Child Was raped by Tam Chung Likes Ku Yue-Cheung Lee Shing-Cheung Au-Yeung Cheung 歐陽昌 Au-Yeung Wai-Lan's brother Chow family Cast Role Description Ram Chiang Leung Cham 梁湛 Master/Mentor of Ku Yue-Cheung Chow Fong Fong's husband Angela Tong Chow Fong-fong 周芳芳 Chow Bing-bing's older sister Leung Cham's wife (Semi-Villain) Nancy Wu Chow Bing-bing 周冰冰 Introduced in Ep.16 Love triangle with Ying Ngan-Ming and Ku Yue-cheung Chow Fong-fong's younger sister Kwan Hung's ex-wife Ku Yue-cheung's ex-girlfriend (Villain) Wing family Cast Role Description Dominic Lam Wing Tak 榮 德 Killed Au-Yeung Biu, Hau Ho-fa and Koo Kin-shing (Main Villain) Kara Hui Cheung Sheung-chu 蔣上珠 Wing tak's wife Shot Koo Kin-shing and injured him (Semi-Villain) Selena Lee Wing Tsz-ching 榮芷晴 Doctor Wing Tak's first child Jacky Heung Wing Man-kwan 榮萬鈞 Killed Ah Kwong Wing Tak's second child (Villain) Angel Chiang (蔣家旻) Wing Tsz-yau 榮芷悠 Wing Tak's third child Ku Yue Yan's girlfriend Other cast Cast Role Description Jack Wu Ho Ho-yin 何浩然 Ku Man-kuen's ex-boyfriend Eric Li Tam Chung 譚忠 Wing Man Kwan's mentor Raped Ying Ngan-Ming (Villain) Helen Ma Chan Kiu 陳嬌 Abducted Ku Yu-cheung and attempted to abduct Ku Yu-tong Lily Li Aunt 12 十二嬸 Helped Cheung Sheung-chu frame Tam Chung ==Awards and nominations== TVB Anniversary Awards (2010) * Nominated: Best Drama * Nominated: Best Actor (Kevin Cheng) * Nominated: Best Supporting Actor (Dominic Lam) Top 5 * Nominated: Best Supporting Actress (Angela Tong) * Nominated: Best Supporting Actress (Kara Hui) * Nominated: Best Supporting Actress (Selena Lee) * Nominated: My Favourite Male Character (Kenneth Ma) Top 5 * Nominated: Most Improved Actor (Alex Lam) * Nominated: Most Improved Actress (Selena Li) * Won: Most Improved Actress (Natalie Tong) ==Viewership ratings== Week Episodes Average Points Peaking Points References 1 March 17–19, 2010 1 — 3 28 30 Week 1 Ratings 2 March 22–26, 2010 4 — 8 29 — Week 2 Ratings 3 March 29 - April 2, 2010 9 — 13 30 32 Week 3 Ratings 4 April 5–9, 2010 14 — 18 31 33 Week 4 Ratings 5 April 12–16, 2010 19 — 23 32 — Week 5 Ratings April 18, 2010 24 — 25 37 43 ==References== ==External links== *TVB.com A Fistful of Stances - Official Website *K for TVB A Fistful of Stances - Series Synopsis Category:TVB dramas Category:2010 Hong Kong television series debuts Category:2010 Hong Kong television series endings
