A programmer's delight, this LP includes "Never Can Say Goodbye," "Never My Love" and the title tune. A particularly strong cut is "Leland Loftis." Should make the Sandpipers once again a big chart group. The February 26, 1972 issue of Record World commented:Record World February 26, 1972 The Sandpipers are crooners with a past, present and future. Here they glide ever-so-softly through songs of fairly recent vintage. Among the pretties made even prettier are "If," "Never My Love," "Never Can Say Goodbye," "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart" and "An Old Fashioned Love Song." The album was the first by the group not to make the Billboard charts after seven entries from 1966 to 1970. In another first for the group, no singles from the album made the U.S., U.K. or Canadian charts. Founding member Richard Shoff did not appear on the album. ==Track listing== Side One #"A Gift of Song" (Patty Ingalls) 3:21 #"It's Too Late" (Carole King) 3:22 #"Never My Love" (Don and Dick Addrisi) 2:49 #"Leland Loftis" (Dale Bobbitt-Jim Brady) 2:44 #"I Think It's Going to Rain Today" (Randy Newman) 2:55 Side Two #"Never Can Say Goodbye" (Clifton Davis) 2:48 #"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart" (Barry and Robin Gibb) 3:29 #"An Old Fashioned Love Song" (Paul Williams) 2:49 #"Chotto Matte Kudasai (Never Say Goodbye)" (Loyal E.
