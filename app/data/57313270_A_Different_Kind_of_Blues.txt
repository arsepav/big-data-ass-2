57313270	A Different Kind of Blues	A Different Kind of Blues is a 1980 album by Itzhak Perlman and André Previn. It contains compositions by Previn. ==Reception== The album was reviewed by Richard S. Ginnel at Allmusic who wrote of Previn and Perlman that "the two classical partners actually made a really charming album the first time around" and compared Previn to "...the proverbial bicyclist who took a long sabbatical but never forgot how to ride", writing that he "still had plenty of keyboard invention in his fingers, and his tunes are consistently witty" and Perlman as "...not quite swinging but creating an alluring illusion of jazz feeling". Ginnel credits the album with anticipating "the rash of 'crossover' albums by classical artists that didn't take hold until late in the 1980s. And it remains more enjoyable than the vast majority of its successors". ==Track listing== *All music written by André Previn #"Look at Him Go" – 3:54 #"Little Face" – 4:16 #"Who Reads Reviews" – 4:15 #"Night Thoughts" – 6:22 #"A Different Kind of Blues" – 6:24 #"Chocolate Apricot" – 5:04 #"The Five of Us" – 2:55 #"Make up Your Mind" – 3:51 ==Personnel== *André Previn – piano *Itzhak Perlman – violin *Jim Hall – guitar *Red Mitchell – double bass *Shelly Manne – drums ===Production=== *Barry Golin – art direction *Marvin Schwartz – cover design *Rick Rankin – cover photo, photography *Michael Sheady – engineer *David Mermelstein – liner notes *Don Hunstein – photography *Suvi Raj Grubb – producer ==References== Category:1980 albums Category:André Previn albums Category:Angel Records albums Category:Itzhak Perlman albums
