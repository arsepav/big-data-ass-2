Written by Joany Kane, the film is about an aspiring interior designer who has a chance encounter with a handsome stranger, with whom she shares an impulsive romantic kiss in an elevator. Later she discovers that he is the wealthy socialite boyfriend of her callous and dominating employer. While decorating and preparing his home for an upcoming holiday charity fundraiser, they get to know each other, and soon he must decide which woman holds the key to his future happiness. Filmed on location in Richmond, Virginia, A Christmas Kiss first aired on December 11, 2011 on the Ion Television network. ==Plot== Wendy works as a busy assistant to the callous designer Priscilla, but has dreams of becoming an interior designer in her own right. After her friends encourage her to focus on herself, Wendy impulsively kisses a handsome stranger while they are trapped together in an elevator but neglects to learn his name. She is later reunited with the man, but is dismayed to learn that he is her boss's boyfriend Adam and that due to the sparkly makeup she was wearing, doesn't recognize her. Wendy and Priscilla are hired to decorate Adam's house for an upcoming Christmas fundraiser. After learning about Adam and his grandmother, Wendy creates a theme centered upon Charles Dickens' 1843 novella A Christmas Carol, as it was a book both enjoyed. Her credit is stolen by Priscilla after Adam dismisses the designer's original idea, portraying it as an alternate theme of hers. While working on the decorations Wendy quickly falls in love with Adam, who in turn realizes that he wants to break up with Priscilla due to their differing values. Priscilla ends up firing Wendy after discovering that she stayed over at Adam's house watching movies, as the two had fallen asleep. She also plants a fake engagement announcement in the newspaper to undermine Adam's plans at breaking up. Priscilla later slips up and reveals that the design was actually Wendy's, which disgusts Adam. The two then go to the local theatre, where he breaks up with Priscilla after being reunited with Wendy. While she is initially reluctant to reconcile with Adam, Wendy and Adam become a couple and the film ends with them becoming engaged. ==Cast== * Elisabeth Röhm as Priscilla Hall * Laura Breckenridge as Wendy Walton * Brendan Fehr as Adam Hughes * Jerrika Hinton as Tressa * Laura Spencer as Caroline * Mark Joy as Charlie * Jimmy Jernigan as Doctor * Mark DeAngelis as Coachman * Michael Waters as Carriage Driver * Steven Ramirez as Caroler (Lip Sync) ==Production== A Christmas Kiss was filmed on location in Richmond, Virginia.
