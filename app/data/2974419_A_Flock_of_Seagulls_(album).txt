On February 17, 2023, a 3CD deluxe edition of A Flock of Seagulls was released to commemorate its 40th anniversary. The 3CD featured a remastered version of the original album, B-sides, single versions, remixes, BBC sessions and a BBC concert from The Paris Theatre, London, which was originally transmitted in January 1982. It also featured sleeve notes by Classic Pop writer John Earls, including a new interview with lead singer and founding band member Mike Score. In addition, the remastered album was also available as a limited-edition transparent orange vinyl LP. ==Reception== The album received good reviews upon its release and radio airplay. In his retrospective review for AllMusic, Tom Demalon gave the album 4.5 stars, calling it "great fun and a wonderful collection of new wave ear candy." Critic Robert Christgau was also happy with it, giving it an A− and saying that it is "so transparently, guilelessly expedient that it actually provides the hook-chocked fun most current pop bands only advertise." Other reviews pointed out the bands "pioneering sounds, compelling hooks and undeniably addictive gimmicks." The band, and particularly this album, were influential during the 1980s for their image and for their production techniques. Record producer Phil Spector called the album "phenomenal." The album track "D.N.A." won a Grammy Award in 1983 for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== A Flock of Seagulls *Mike Score – lead vocals, keyboards, additional rhythm guitar *Paul Reynolds – lead and rhythm guitar, backing vocals *Frank Maudsley – bass guitar, backing vocals *Ali Score – drums, percussion Production *Mike Howlett – production (all tracks except "Telecommunication", "Tanglimara" and "Intro") *Bill Nelson – production ("Telecommunication") *Steve Lovell and A Flock of Seagulls – production ("Tanglimara" and "Intro") *Mark Dearnley – engineering *Mike Shipley – engineering *"BillBo" – mastering ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== 1982 weekly chart performance for A Flock of Seagulls Chart (1982) Peak position Australia Albums (Kent Music Report) 19 US Rock Albums (Billboard) 8 2023 weekly chart performance for A Flock of Seagulls Chart (2023) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== 1982 year-end chart performance for A Flock of Seagulls Chart (1982) Position Australian Albums (Kent Music Report) 100 Canada Top Albums/CDs (RPM) 35 New Zealand Albums (RMNZ) 31 US Billboard 200 63 1983 year-end chart performance for A Flock of Seagulls Chart (1983) Position US Billboard 200 94 ==Certifications== ==References== ===Bibliography=== * Category:1982 debut albums Category:Albums produced by Mike Howlett Category:Cherry Red Records albums Category:A Flock of Seagulls albums Category:Jive Records albums Category:Science fiction concept albums
