While treating the patient, he fails to find the fatal wound which results in humiliation by the villagers and an endless return trip, losing everything. It tells the story of the continuous pressure on doctors, and the never-ending impossible expectations laying on their shoulders. ==References== == External links == * * * Category:2000s animated short films Category:2007 anime films Category:Anime short films Category:Films based on short fiction Category:Films based on works by Franz Kafka Category:Medical-themed films Category:Shochiku films Category:Films directed by Kōji Yamamura
