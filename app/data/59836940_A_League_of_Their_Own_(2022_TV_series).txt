Graham loved the film growing up and approached Jacobson with the idea for a contemporary reboot, expanding it to explore race and sexuality. Graham and Jacobson contacted Marshall (before her death in 2018) and Geena Davis to ask for their blessing before moving forward with the project. Graham and Jacobson decided to expand the topics explored to include racism in the league as well as the stories of queer players. They hired a researcher to gather detailed information about the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, and met with surviving players. Max's character is an amalgamation of three real-life Black women players from the Negro leagues: Toni Stone, Mamie Johnson, and Connie Morgan. In March 2020, it was announced that the series was in development at Amazon. It is the second television adaptation of A League of Their Own, following a short-lived 1993 CBS series. Jamie Babbit directed the pilot episode, which was shot in southern California. Babbit, Hailey Wierengo, and Elizabeth Koe are executive producers along with writer-producers Graham and Jacobson, who also co-stars. The series is Jacobson's second major project following Broad City, which ran for five seasons. On August 6, 2020, it was announced that Amazon had ordered the one-hour comedy series. On March 14, 2023, Deadline reported that Amazon Prime Video renewed the series for a four-episode second and final season. ===Casting=== On February 14, 2020, D'Arcy Carden, Chanté Adams, Roberta Colindrez, Gbemisola Ikumelo, Kelly McCormack, Melanie Field, and Priscilla Delgado were announced.

Production took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from mid-July through October 2021. Filming officially began on July 11, 2021, on the south side of Pittsburgh in the old Schwartz Market. Additional filming locations included Ambridge, the Fifth Street Park, Aliquippa at Morrell Field, and the city of Greensburg's Amtrak train station. == Release == A world premiere screening took place at Tribeca Film Festival on June 13, 2022. To promote the show a 30th Anniversary screening of the original film was held in Los Angeles by Cinespia on August 7. The series premiered on Prime Video on August 12, 2022. ==Reception== The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the show an approval rating of 94% based on reviews from 83 critics, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "A League of Their Own puts some spin on its pitch, lobbing a serialized expansion that swerves dangerously close to anachronism but hits home thanks to a roster filled with all-stars and a field rich with possibilities." Metacritic gave the series a weighted average score of 70 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Jenna Scherer rated the series an A- for The A.V. Club and stated: "That the show effortlessly weaves this diverse tapestry of women's stories is no easy feat. But League is funny as hell to boot, using a quasi-contemporary conversation style and modern slang ("Fucking fuckers!") that feels oddly at home in the 1940s setting." Autostraddle critic Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya wrote positively about the LGBTQ+ content in the series: "Thirty years after the original, this story finally gets to be as gay as it should be...And it's not just the sheer number of queer characters but also the great space and weight given to queerness within just about every single plotline and subplot of this new A League of Their Own that truly makes up for the lack of explicitly gay content in the original movie — and then some." Daniel D'Addario of Variety wrote that the show "feels a bit overextended" but hailed the acting: "there are strong performances throughout a deep ensemble and a winning eagerness to be openly, earnestly emotional." Linda Holmes of NPR also praised the acting and noted: "D'Arcy Carden, who a lot of TV audiences will mostly know as Janet ("not a robot" but ... kind of a robot) on The Good Place, is warm and bold and quite dreamy in this role — deeply human, in fact." In a less positive review, Ben Travers rated A League of Their Own a B- in IndieWire and wrote that splitting the narrative between two parallel story lines "creates pacing issues where things like the team's inaugural baseball game gets surprisingly short shrift" but also noted "most of its first season problems are common issues for freshman TV shows, and the Prime Video original smooths out with each passing episode." Peter Travers of ABC News also stated that the series "lacks the warm, gooey center of Marshall’s feel-good movie" but praised it as "refreshingly queer and diverse". == Awards and nominations == * 2022 – Honoree, Critics Choice Association Women's Committee Seal of Female Empowerment in Entertainment * 2022 – Honoree, Human Rights Campaign National Visibility Award * 2022 – Honoree, National Council of La Raza Voice and Visibility Award (for Abbi Jacobson) Year Award Category Nominee(s) Result 2023 GLAAD Media Awards Outstanding New TV Series A League of Their Own 2023 Independent Spirit Awards Best Supporting Performance in a New Scripted Series Gbemisola Ikumelo 2023 NAACP Image Awards Outstanding Costume Design (Television or Film) Trayce Gigi Field == References == == External links == * * Category:2020s American comedy-drama television series Category:2020s American LGBT-related comedy television series Category:2022 American television series debuts Category:2020s American LGBT-related television series Category:American sports television series Category:Baseball television series Category:English- language television shows Category:Bisexuality-related television series Category:Lesbian-related television shows Category:LGBT sports Category:Transgender-related television shows Category:Live action television shows based on films Category:Television productions postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Television series reboots Category:Television series set in 1943 Category:Television shows filmed in California Category:Television shows filmed in Pittsburgh Category:Television shows set in Illinois Category:Television series by Amazon Studios Category:Television series by Sony Pictures Television Category:Amazon Prime Video original programming
